{"prompt":"\"\n\nNot enough in-line citations\nPerhaps you might like to comment on my stance over here?  \n\n re:Image:AnotherVersionofthePast.jpg \n\nI saw your post to ^demon regarding this image. I cannot undelete the image because of WP:FUC #3.b. The image has not been reduced in size. I also believe it fails #2 in that it directly competes with the commercial opportunities of the copyright holder. #8 is also jumping out at me, because the summarized text in the article serves the same purpose as the image. There is not critical commentary about the design of the sight or visual representation of the image in the article Chronology of the Year Zero alternate reality game. Therefore, the exact image you uploaded isn't appropriate for use on wikipedia, and a cropped or reduced size image may theoretically be appropriate, but in the proposed article would just be decorative (and against out non-free content policy). Sorry, but I hope this explanation helps.- [talk] \nThanks very much for the reply.  I understand your Fair-Use concerns, and hopefully I can address all of them.\nFUC 3.b - Agreed.  If the image is undeleted I'd be happy to reduce it's size and upload the smaller version, but I can't really do that (download the high resolution version) until it is undeleted.\nFUC #2 - There are no commercial opportunities at stake here.  Because of the odd nature of the website, as part of an alternate reality game, the only logical copyright holder would be either Nine Inch Nails, 42 Entertainment, or Interscope records.  No one is making any money off of these websites: in fact, they officially have absolutely no connection to any company, not even to the album (Year Zero (album)) that it is parallel to.  Reznor himself has stated the ARG is NOT a promotional device.  (see Year Zero (alternate reality game) for more info on that)\nFUC #8 - Although the dates themselves are similar, the text is not.  The whole point of the originating website, Another Version of the Past is that there are multiple perspectives of past events.  The text in the WP article is a dry, point-for-point account: \"\"neutral\"\" if you will.  The two versions of the time line presented on the website represent both extremes of the fictional issues at hand: pro-American, pro-government, etc and on the other hand extremist, rebellious, reformatory, etc.  The image provides the user an opportunity to see the POV\/agendas at work and compare it to what actually happened.  For example the New Orleans floods are described as a \"\"Faith-based disaster\"\" on one hand, and \"\"Why Bother with New Orleans?\"\" on the other.  \nI still believe the image wouldn't be appropriate here. The site the image came from is copyrighted, and was used to promote the album (for the record company executives), regardless what Reznor said, so FUC#2 still concerns me, and I'm not convinced of FUC#8 either. We can simply quote snippets of text without showing it if we want to discuss how the timeline is presented. We'd need to discuss visual aspects of how things look in order to show an image, IMO. I have asked another admin who is more versed in image policy to comment here, so be patient for a 2nd opinion. Thanks for your reply.- [talk] \n\nGreetings. I was asked to comment here. This image is essentially text, with decorative flourishes. As such, I don't see how  it could pass WP:NFCC#8, which requires that a non-free image provide encyclopedic information beyond what text alone could convey. I don't believe that the text alone, quoted, would be less informative than the image. (And I think that much text, quoted verbatim, would be a copyright violation, which is another indicator that this image isn't allowed.) All the best, –  (talk) (random) \nOk, fair enough.

Reform in Interfaith Meeting \n\nWHAT: \"\"10th Annual True Family Values Awards Banquet\"\" News Conference \n\nWHEN: TODAY, Sept. 24, 11 a.m. Diplomat Room \n\nWHERE: Hyatt Regency O'Hare, Grand Ballroom, 9300 Bryn Mawr Ave., Rosemont, Ill. \n\nWHO: Rev. and Mrs. Sun Myung Moon; Archbishop George Augustus Stallings, Imani Temple African American Catholic Congregation; Imam Ameer Salahuddin, Islamic Center of Passaic County; Pastor Leroy Elliott, New Greater St. John Missionary Baptist Church; Rabbi David Ben-Ami, American Forum for Jewish-Christian-Muslim Cooperation; Rev. Jesse Edwards, Pentecostal Family Church, Philadelphia, PA; Rev. A. P. Randall, Pastor of Twelve Gates Missionary Baptist Church; Rabbi Dr. Mordechai Waldman, Southfield, MI; Rev. Dr. C. Phillip Johnson, New Prospect Family Praise and Worship Center, Dr. Arnold Howard, Enon Baptist Church, national and local interfaith leaders. \n\nBACKGROUND: The Reverend Sun Myung Moon has launched what some believe is his final speaking tour in America, issuing a series of challenges to this nation. Rev. Moon's visit to Chicago coincides with the 10th Annual True Family Values Awards Banquet. A crowd expected at more than 2000 will help celebrate as a number of Chicago community leaders receive appointments as Ambassadors For Peace. The 12 US venues represent the first leg of a 100-city world tour to inaugurate the Universal Peace Federation. \n\nAsserting that peace cannot be achieved through diplomatic and military means alone, Moon emphasizes the need for interreligious reconciliation, calling for renewal and reform at the United Nations. Addressing the economic and racial divisions in America and the world, he proposes cooperative international efforts in key areas. \"\"Why must we continue pouring countless dollars into wars that, in the end, will never bring the reconciliation of enemies\"\" Moon asks. \"\"The time has come for all countries to pool their resources and advance toward the world of peace desired by God.\"\" \n\nThe still-dynamic spiritual leader has launched a dramatic appeal to the world community to undertake the most ambitious civil engineering project in history  a 51-mile bridge and tunnel connecting the United States and Russia, physically and symbolically uniting East and West, to be built across the Bering Strait at a cost of over $200bn. Moon asserts that such projects will help connect the world as a single community, generate economic development, and redirect the focus of the world's leadership. The Universal Peace Federation promotes interreligious reconciliation, family renewal and cooperative service for others as the basis for lasting peace. \n\n\"\"Rev. Moon has been building bridges all his life to bring the races and religions of the world together. It is natural that he would now launch this visionary appeal to physically unite the world in a project that demands peaceful cooperation.\"\"  Archbishop George Stallings, Christianity (Washington., D.C.) \n\n\"\"The man is hitting on all the spiritual hot buttons of contemporary society, including racial and interfaith relations, marriage and family, homosexuality, fighting AIDS, peace in the Middle East, and what is more, he's never pulled his punches.\"\"  Rev.

{"prompt":"\"\n\nLet us examine what is considered \"\"Black\"\" in the context of this very article. At the very top it states:\n\n\"\"It is also used to categorize a number of diverse populations together based on historical and prehistorical ancestral relationships. Some definitions of the term include only people of relatively recent Sub Saharan African descent (see African diaspora). Among the members of this group, dark skin is most often accompanied by the expression of natural afro-hair texture (although a recent scientific study notes that human skin color diversity is highest in sub-Saharan African populations). Other definitions of the term \"\"black people\"\" extend to other populations characterized by dark skin, including some indigenous to Oceania and Southeast Asia\"\"\n\nThis article even mentions Oceanians and Southeast Asians (such as the Great Andamanese, Native Fijians, the Ati,  and the Melanesians) even though these groups genetically have more in common with neighboring Asian populations and are very distant from other people who are considered Black Africans. Ethiopians are black Africans. Some of them have Middle-Eastern ancestry (Ethiopia is a short boat ride from Arabia), but that automatically does not make them an entirely mixed population; nor does it change the fact that their roots are mainly in Africa. Sicilians have some Middle-Eastern ancestry, but they are still considered European. Ancient Romans certainly referred to Ethiopians as black. They used the term \"\"Ethiopian\"\" to describe all Black Africans they came across, regardless of their location outside of East Africa (read this: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Roman_expeditions_to_Sub-Saharan_Africa)\n\nI went to the Beta Israel page and found two very clear references: \n\nEphraim Isaac (1974), The Falasha: Black Jews of Ethiopia. Dillard University Scholar Statesman Lecture Series.\n\nSimon D. Messing (1982). The Story of the Falashas \"\"Black Jews of Ethiopia\"\". Brooklyn. ISBN 0-9615946-9-1\n\nHere's more from another article (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Racism_in_Israel#Black_Hebrew_Israelite_immigration)\n\nRebhun, Uzi, Jews in Israel: contemporary social and cultural patterns\n\n\"\"The Israeli government has airlifted black Ethiopian Jews to Israel and given them citizenship in the same way it has been a haven to Jews oppressed throughout the Middle East and Africa\"\"\n\n\"\"She told RT: “They don't want poor or black children and Depo-Provera gave them the opportunity to have control. If she [a patient] keeps taking an injection every three months, she is not going to have children – you know it is a 100 per cent secure from children I think.”\n\nHedva says the policy is working – the number of black babies in Israel is decreasing, but there are no official statistics to back up her claim. For community workers and Ethiopian women here, statistics are unnecessary – they feel their reality speaks for itself.\n\nThe Health Ministry admits it issues the drug, but says it was never its policy only to administer it to Ethiopian women and reduce the number of black babies in the country.\"\"\n\nI would say that makes Ethiopian Jew's a valid part of this article.\n\n(Click Here to leave a message)\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no_no_no_no_no_no"}

Did you know that Republic of Serbia and Serbian Republic are two different places?!?\n\nFairly recently, Blair made it virtually impossible for the UK to not adopt the euro by 2010, despite public opinion. To circumvent public opinion, Blair's government conducted a poll of corporations which turned up a 90% favorable return toward adoption. The suggestion has been made- and is being debated as part of a potential agreement- to allow Scotland, Wales, N. Ireland and England to issue seperate euro coins in order to preserve the cultural connection to their currency. Personally, I don't think the ECB will go for this, but stranger things have happened. There is already a confusion factor (eurozone wide) regarding euro coin designs- introducing 9 more designs between now and 2010 will only serve to compound the problem. There would be 200 different legal tender coins in circulation! This doesn't take into account the new common design or the 2 euro commemoratives.

Although the article mostly discusses Euler spirals, it seems to give the impression that's the only curve used, under varying names.  However, consider this quotation (from the AREMA reference in the article):\nThere are several different types of mathematical spirals available for use, including the clothoid, the cubic parabola and the lemniscate.  Of more common use on railways are the Searles, the Talbot and the AREMA 10-Chord spirals, which are empirical approximations of true spirals.\nThis reference is, of course, discussing common use on American railways; but even in this limited context, it appears there are at least three ideal mathematical spiral forms involved: \"\"the clothoid, the cubic parabola and the lemniscate\"\", along with various practical approximations to them.\n\nThe article would ideally give the history of the use and adaptation of these various spiral forms.  Doing so would provide a solid illustration of how technological innovation was both necessitated and encouraged by the Age of Rail - a valuable insight into the social impact of rail.\n\nI'm guessing that the AREMA reference probably continues on from the quote above to give some further detail about those approximations, their inventors and their history; but it may not.

{"prompt":"\"\n\nElen, thank you for proving my point.  Meant seriously in saying so.  And no, I am not finished.\n\n1, if Wikipedia is not a publisher of THE TRUTH (TM), it cannot then call itself an encyclopedia (Pillar #1).  It can, at best, and using your own definition here, Elen, be a publicly-accepted repository of publicly-accepted \"\"facts\"\" accepted by the public.  I said that three times to make a point.  The repository is only made by publicly-accepted parties, the facts are also only those the collective shall accept, and the amount of verification is similar.\n\nI point to the Wrestlemania XXVIII dispute.  This user has decided to use wikia-level \"\"evidence\"\", but, since the public has accepted his stand, I am not allowed to challenge it.  And he's lying on top of it!  And if that, and other places I've attempted to edit, are any indication, this kind of conduct probably goes on all over the site!\n\nThe problem with the \"\"sports organization\"\" (the BCS case) is that if that organization has removed the valid sanction of an event, then it creates an inconsistency between verifiability and damnatio memoriae.  If Wikipedia fancies itself an encyclopedia, then, it grants a sanction which no longer exists  in fact, it basically grants a status of \"\"fact\"\" to something now ruled complete fiction due to the misconduct of one of the teams involved!  (And solely because the public accepts it.)  The problem comes in that Wikipedia, as an encyclopedia (and I will call this site on that again and again), grants a statement of \"\"fact\"\" on something which is now fiction, because the public has decided that the event, since it physically took place, cannot be reversed, even if all evidence points to the fact that it should've been.\n\n(And, yes, I will find the same farcical situation in many sports articles.)\n\nAnd if I must find a \"\"published fact\"\" for something, then personal knowledge becomes irrelevant to the process.  (The Final Fantasy case.)  If we are not going to trust the general public to do research (WP:OR), how do we trust the general public not to manipulate the \"\"published facts\"\" (which see Mania XXVIII)?  Personally, speaking generally, I don't trust most members of the public (far beyond Wikipedia) to spell \"\"CAT\"\" if they are spotted the \"\"C\"\" and the \"\"A\"\".  How am I going to trust them with a public repository of the \"\"facts\"\" when they get to determine what is \"\"fact\"\" and who gets to post it?

(One of my (ignored) claims was that the level of \"\"promo\"\" of that match is the same as the level of promo in the Daniel Bryan intended-cash-in!)\n\nAnd in stating \"\"These are some of our rules\"\", you openly abdicate Pillar #5 by your own statement.  The choice is yours, not mine, because the public apparently gets to determine everything in Wikipedia as I said above.  How can I carry on an intelligent and informed conversation with someone like ChristianandJericho, who basically does not know proper English and chooses to type like a 12 year-old girl into a cellphone?

{"prompt":"Your absolutely right there is no consistency. I agree with you that the Air Canada severe turbulence incident is not worthy of inclusion but I disagree in the case of the landing gear collapse because although there were no injuries the aircraft was written off. I also had no reason to go to the Air Canada page. But the big difference between the Air Canada article and this article is that this Ryanair article is already messed up. If you were to include this incident the next time something happens they will point to this incident as the reason why the new incident should be included even if minor (example: criticism section) Personally I don't even think that Ryanair flight 296 should be included and it definitely should not have it's own article. For one, there was no fire (which it says in the main article and flight 296 article) only smoke from the release of oil from the broken bearing. Secondly it was the passengers who opened and tried to exit on the wrong side (not sure how that is Ryanair's fault that passengers would exit towards the firefighters) Thirdly, the only problem for Ryanair is that some of the staff had trouble opening the doors but still everybody was able to evacuate in 90 seconds. Then in the flight 296 wiki article they even talk about how paying for uniforms and training in eastern Europe had something to do with the incident even though no ref is provided. But I know that if I delete anything about it I would probably end up in another edit war. 76.19.222.40\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no_no_no_no_no_no"}

{"prompt":"\"\n\nRemoved to be readded\n\nAfter the Christian population of the bishoprics of Skopje and Ohrid voted in 1874 overwhelmingly in favour of joining the Exarchate (Skopje by 91%, Ohrid by 97%), the Bulgarian Exarchate became in control of the whole of Vardar and Pirin Macedonia. The Exarchate was also represented in the whole of southern Macedonia. The “Macedonian Question,” became especially prominent after the Balkan wars in 1912-1913 and the subsequent division of Macedonia between the three neighboring states, followed by tensions between them over possession of Macedonia. This partitioning of the territory had a tremendous influence on the development of the Macedonian national identity.Center for Documentation and Information on Minorities in Europe - Southeast Europe (CEDIME-SE)MINORITIES IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE - Macedonians of Bulgaria, pg. 6  In order to legitimise their claims, each of these countries tried to 'persuade' the population into allegiance. Paul Fouracre. Cambridge Encyclopedia of Medieval History Some scientists argue also that the use of any ethnic definition of the Slav speekers in Macedonia during the 19th and early 20th Century did not refer to ethnicity, but rather a socio-occupational description. The Slav population in Macedonia tended to be Christian peasents, farming folk,The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World - Loring M. Danforth, ISBN13: 978-0-691-04356-2 attested socio-political circumstances, such as in what language the local schooling was provided, or whether the local church aligned itself with Serbian, Bulgarian or Greek Orthodoxy. The majority were under the influence of the Bulgarian Exarchate and its education system, thus in the early 20th century and beyond, were regarded as Bulgarians, whatever that meant.(Brubaker 1996: 153; Ruhl 1916: 6; Perry in Lorrabee 1994: 61)The 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica. The Races and Religions of Macedonia, \"\"National Geographic\"\", November 1912. Carnegie Endowment for International peace.REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION. To Inquire into the causes and Conduct OF THE BALKAN WARS, PUBLISHED BY THE ENDOWMENT WASHINGTON, D.C. 1914  However, the key events in the formation of a distinctive Macedonian identity emerged during the first half of the 20th century in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913 when the Bulgarian Exarchate discontinued its activity in most of the region. The process strengthed especially following the Second World War, with the withdrawal of Bulgarian authorities from Macedonia, the establishment of Yugoslav Macedonian Republic and the signing of Bled agreement. With the founding of the People's Republic of Macedonia in 1944 as part of SFRY, a sense of a Macedonian national identity gained strength and became systematised.(Bell 1998:193) The Yugoslav government began a policy of removing any Bulgarian influence and cementing the Macedonian identity.Europe since 1945.

{"prompt":"\"\n\nGetaway: Thank you for your comments. I most certainly did give my reasons  Read my previous comment. What you didn't do is raise any points on the discussion page before making changes. As for your charges:\n\n1) FAIR and Media Matters are certainly media watchdogs, even though they're political. All media watchdogs are political. Rush Limbaugh is political. That doesn't make any of their views invalid, but it does call for balance. \n\n2) Phrases like \"\"axe to grind\"\" serve no function in intelligent debate. It would be equally pointless to argue that Limbaugh has an \"\"axe to grind.\"\" He does, and I don't have a problem with that. He has every right to have an axe to grind here in the land of free speech, and so do FAIR and Media Matters. Having an axe to grind is just one way to say somebody takes a certain political position. Limbaugh's positions are one POV of a partisan debate and FAIR's are another. Their axes, excuse me, their views need to be balanced. By the way, I don't know as much about Media Matters as about FAIR, but FAIR makes no claim to be \"\"neutral and nonpartisan\"\" as you suggest. What they claim is to be accurate. You're welcome to challenge that accuracy, with sources. Which leads to my next point:\n\n3) It's very easy to toss out weasel words like \"\"MM and FAIR both have long records of inaccuracy\"\" but you're not providing any evidence that their charges against Limbaugh are fallacious or inaccurate. Judging from Limbaugh's feeble response to FAIR's charges, we might be tempted to conclude that Limbaugh can't answer FAIR because FAIR got it right. If there's a problem with FAIR's accuracy, you're welcome to include it, with sources, in the paragraph. (I've issued this invitation three times already and nobody has taken me up on it.) But you do not get to blindly assert that FAIR isn't a credible source without any evidence to back you up, and you don't get to water down what I've written just because you don't like FAIR's work or because you can't find sources to back up your position.\n\n4) FAIR isn't merely expressing opinion. It's documenting errors of fact. Please don't confuse opinion with fact, they're not the same thing at all. When Limbaugh claims that suspending rules on minority hiring will make earthquake repairs go quickly, he's stating an opinion. But when Limbaugh says the government suspended rules on minority hiring, he's making a statement of fact. FAIR is taking issue with Limbaugh's facts. \n\n5) I'm not asking for special treatment for FAIR. I'm asking that, as per NPOV rules, their view get equal treatment. Are you asking for special treatment for Limbaugh's views? \n\n6) Please focus on substance? I am. I feel it's important to provide a historical perspective on this controversy, and I feel the article needs to illustrate of the depth and scope of the controversy, which is provided by the Media Matters quote. I also feel this section needs a defining introductory sentence. For these reasons, I'm restoring much of the previous text. If you disagree, please take issue with me on this page. \n\nBTW I feel that Allen3 made a useful clarifying edit in an earlier revision, when he labeled FAIR a \"\"progressive\"\" organization, and provided a link to an article. I find that much more accurate than \"\"Liberal,\"\" since FAIR keeps its distance from classic liberalism, and sometimes takes issue with people who call themselves Liberal. Can we keep the \"\"Progressive\"\" label?  \"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no_no_no_no_no_no"}

If it were (was) me, I'd feel comfortable semi-protecting the article for 3 days, *maybe* a week if I was frustrated.\nFinally, generally the semi-protection ramps up in length. So a common pattern I use is 3 days, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 12 months, then indefinite. Each time it should come unprotected and show big problems with IPs.\nAs an aside, I didn't mean for this to be so long, and apologies if you know all of this. I tried to cast it as a personal opinion because it somewhat *is*. And I'm being so verbose because you are a new admin (congrats, of course), and I'm hoping it helps without coming off condescending.\nHeh, that was a LOT of rambling.

{"prompt":"Sure. First I'm not Chomsky or Finkelstein but their POV is similar to mine on many issues. But to explain my POVand I hope I'm logicalI'm against all States. I'm not an anarchist, either; I see States as a necessary evil given the current state of human civilization. But they should not be glorified as a an end, but as a means to an end, the end being peace, security for ALL, democracy, people before profits, equality ect (progressive values). \n\nStates should never be supported when they rest on the oppresssion of others. I oppose all conquest and imperialism, past and present. As far as states created by conquest, what is important is current oppression, i.e.  ending it,(esp. state-sponsored) that are in the bussiness of building based on conquest of others. This must be opposed equally in all cases, which a special responsiblity for those you can have the greatest effect in changing, stoping, i.e. if I live in the US, I have a special responsiblity to speak out against things this countries does (directly or indirectly as in the case of support for Israeli occupation).\n\nAs for the meaning of a national homeland, it could mean the country of origin and native land of a people who have a strong cultural connection and history within such a territory , a cultural geography. There are many ethnic groups who holds a long history and a deep cultural association different country or geographical regions, in particular where the national identity began. And, diffferent groups can live in peace side to side, with different language, cultures, co-existing with the same country, united under the common accepted cultural norms of democratic values. This does not negate a national homeland, only having it based on the oppression of others. Hence, I'm able to be for a national homeland for the Jewish people in the land of Israel while at the same time I'm anti-Zionist and advocate for a binational state.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no_no_no_no_no_no"}
{"prompt":"\"\n\nHarald88, you are mixing up everything again like an autodidact, and you don't want to listen. You know once again  everything in advance and much better than anybody else. What you are stating here, however, is nonsense again. The classical forerunner of SRT has been  optics of moving bodies, a discipline dealing with the observation of  point source from a moving platform, which is governed by Bradley's law of velocity aberration. A point source emits spherical waves, not plane waves.\n\nIn none of the references stated in the nonsensible Wikipedia article on the transverse Doppler effect, to which you have contributed, a proof is delivered, but it is simply asserted there that the transverse Doppler effect has been unknown in classical physics. In dozens of textbooks this nonsense is repeated without proof because authors tend to write off from one another.\n\n'Proofs' of the nonsense are delivered in Chapter 11 of J. D. Jackson's book on clsssical electrodynamics as well as in a German book on SRT by Greiner\/Rafelski who probably have copied the 'deduction' offered in Jackson's book (who himself probably got that 'deduction' from somewhere else). These 'deductions' boil down to direct betrayal of naive students, because the students are made to believe that a point source, such as a fixed star, does emit plane waves rather than spherical waves. Nobody tells them that the plane wave approximation is only an approximation and that it is, therefore, completely useless to 'prove' something ia a context of paramount importance. \n\nThe nonsense of the 'non-existing classical Doppler effect' spreads in the literature since Einstein published in 1907 a short note, where he had stated that the transverse Doppler effect, which already Stark wanted to measure (why, if it is unknown in classical optics of moving bodies?), is \"\"important\"\", but not that it is \"\"unknown\"\" in classical physics. It apparently has to do with the hystery which seems to capture most people who get in touch\nwith the special relativity nonsense.\n\nIn reality SRT departs from classical optics of moving bodies solely for the case of longitudinal observation.\n\nThis I was going to demonstrate in the article Modern Galilean relativity.\n\nBecause of your unprofessional interference with that article I stopped today contributing to it.\n\nSince you have the big mouth and know everything better, I suggest that you finish the article\nnow. \"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no_no_no_no_no_no"}

It is also a name by which the governing authority refers to itself as. However, this causes a conflict. As a person who apparently holds logic in high esteem, I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this. It is not clear, to many people throughout the world, what is meant by \"\"Ireland\"\". Unless you are from there (and even then, there can often be confusion), usually the context is not''''' understood. I think in this case, whereby the subject of education is a governmental and state-specific, and whereby the system does not concern a wider jurisdiction of the whole of the island of Ireland, the more unambiguous title should be given to the country.\n\nOtherwise, people (mostly people not from that region of the world) will make an incorrect assumption. A link to the more relevant article is not enough: I doubt most people would hover their mouse over the link or click on it to find out what \"\"Ireland\"\" is.

{"prompt":"\"SOME HISTORICAL DATA FOR KEMAH, TEXAS\n\n NATIVE INHABITANTS \n\nThe history of Kemah, Texas goes back more than 180 years. The Karankawa Indians, a group of five nomadic, linguistically related groups including the Cocos, Cujanes, Karankawas proper, Coapites, and Copanos, occupied the area from Galveston Bay to Corpus Christi Bay during the late Spring and Summer months. Evidence of the Karankawas near present-day Kemah was discovered back in the 1890s. This discovery will be discussed later in the article. Indian inhabitants began to leave when European settlers arrived, and most had retreated from the area by 1850.\n\n THE DISAPPEARING FOUNDER \n\nThe recorded history of Kemah began in the early 1800s, when Texas was still under the Mexican flag. On August 24, 1824, the Mexican government granted a labor (approx. 177 acres) of land to to a settler by the name of Michael Gouldrich. Gouldrich was listed as one of Stephen F. Austin’s first colonists in 1826, a widower over 50 years of age engaged in farming and stockraising. His land was located on the south bank of Clear Creek, where the creek flows into Galveston Bay. Oddly enough, Gouldrich disappeared from historical record after his recorded receipt of the land grant. No historical records or accounts identify him with any development of a settlement, homestead, or right of way at his claim location. Odder still, there is no record of his death. \n\n \"\"FLANDERS GROVE\"\" \n\nSometime between 1826 and 1830, a man by the name of William Vince of Vince’s Bayou, Harrisburg County, acquired the Clear Creek land. On several early maps of Galveston Bay dating back to that time period, the name “Flanders Grove” or “Flanders Labor” appears in the vicinity of the present day town of Kemah, at the mouth of Clear Lake. The place-name has ties to a New Hampshire native by the name of John Flanders. John was the son of Levi and Mary (Sargent) Flanders and was born in Salisbury, Massachusetts. John had been in business with his father in New Hampshire. No record exists concerning the nature of business John and his father owned, although apparently at least a part of the business they conducted dealt in real estate. In the time immediately prior to John's move to the Texas territory, he and his father had a disagreement over a mortgage held by John on a piece of property owned by a widow. John wished to foreclose and his father opposed it. The disagreement developed into bad feelings and John left home, never communicating with his family thereafter.\n\nJohn Flanders was issued a passport for six months on December 7, 1830, in Austin’s colony. A notation in Austin’s Register of Families reads, “Flanders is to be included as a colonist although he takes no land.” Flanders, a 32-year-old  single farmer at the time, had arrived in the Galveston Bay region in mid to late December 1930. It is believed that his first place of residence was in Anahuac, Texas, on the northern tip of Galveston Bay. There, he acquired a house and a lot. However, he was not listed on the 1834 census of Anahuac and it is believed that somtime between early 1931 and the time of the 1934 census Flanders made the purchase of William Vince's land. Since the 1934 censuse does not record Flanders' name as a resident of Anahuac, it is reasonable to assume that he was probably living on his Clear Creek property by that time.\n\nSadly enough, John Flanders was listed among the dead at the Alamo. He was one of thirty-two men, commanded by Captain George Kimball, who entered the Alamo on March 1, from Gonzales. Why he was with the men from Gonzales is unknown. Flanders was a Private under Kimball, 36 years old at the time of the Alamo seige, and still unmarried.\n\n THE MYSTERY HEIRS \n\nWith John Flander's death came some interesting and mysterious dealings concerning his estate that, of course, included the \"\"Flanders Grove\"\"\/\"\"Flanders Labor\"\" tract. In 1841, Allen Vince, brother of the now-deceased William Vince and resident of Vince’s Bayou, Harris County, was named administrator of the John Flanders estate. The estate was said to consist of only the labor of land at the mouth of Clear Creek on the Southwest side. A petition for sale of the land, to satisfy debts, was requested May 28, 1844. The deceased Vince owed money for lawyer fees (in the case of Sawyer vs Vince in District Court). The land was appraised at $2.00 per acre and sold to Jonathan D. Waters on July 2, 1844 for $354.00. This transaction leaves open the questions of whether or not Flanders still owed William Vince any monies for the land purchase, and how much legal right Allen Vince had to sell the land and use the revenues to pay of a debt on behalf of his brother's estate, instead of keeping the Flanders estate intact.\n\nLet's digress from the Kemah historical table a moment as we\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no_no_no_no_no_no"}

Usenet, FOLDOC, Mathworld at wolfram.com, and even Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia of Sequences all have lots of Smarandache-related entries. Sloane's is an interesting case, since each entry lists an author, and for the Smarandache entries the authors are charlestle@yahoo.com and other possible pseudonyms. Also,the link shown on the FS talk page (http:\/\/www.uoregon.edu\/~ncp\/Spam\/SpamFiles3\/DigitalLibSpam.txt) appears to show him sending unsolicited email under an assumed name.

{"prompt":"\"Actually, I became interested in editing this very short article (amid Wikipedia's invitation for us to participate in the survey, ending November 3), when all newspapers were flooded with Burlesque King. Nograles was forced to run naked in the hotel. Now, I was not a Wikipedian then, but, when, the landmark acquittal suit was published, I took time to edit this tersely. Nograles placed 2nd to my 1975 counsel in civil case, Atty. Henry R. Villarica, 92.35% higher than Ferdinand Marcos' 92.35% trimmed from 99% due to Marcos blunder in political law subject, in an En Banc review of his test results, 1939. Villarica owns more than 100 pawnshops, and is a very close friend-business assoc. of my brother, in gold and (they have 41\/2 ha. Sta. Maria, Bulacan) fighting cock farm. I don't know Ateneo Law School Nograles, but due to the bar rating 2nd place, he is so brilliant. Now, in my 6,500 edits, I happened to have seen and edited like this controversy in bios of USA Senators, etc. So, I just follow the Wikipedia pattern. The difference between Dante Tinga and Nograles, is that, the former was cleared by the Court, but, the Nograles issue of censoring publication by libel lawsuit vs. the naked running, was condemned after Court acquittal for lack of evidence. In Nograles, the acquittal is best Wikipedia evidence to go forth with the edit on Nograles bio-naked thing. Remember the Beatrix of the Netherlands IP address fiasco caught by Wiki scanner? On August 31, 2007, Queen Beatrix’s royal family affirmed that Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau, 38, and his wife Princess Mabel Wisse Smit edited the entry on Wikipedia which described Mabel’s relationship with slain drug baron Klaas Bruinsma (using the queen's palaces’ computer). The changes were found by Dutch media using Wiki Scanner - the entry which states Mabel provided \"\"incomplete and false information\"\" about Bruinsma was changed to just \"\"incomplete information\"\" in January 2006. My point is, in Tinga and Nograles, irrespective of Court acquittal or clearance, the publication of the bribe and Nog's U.P. Oblation run, respectively, with reliable sources, licenses us, editors, to add \"\"the thing.\"\" On short edits, I respect IT and other editors, since, it is a matter of style. If I were not a judge or lawyer, or if I were not an A.B. communication, editor, then, like IT and math editors, I would edit with a sentence or 2. But I keep my edits to 3 sentences for this reason: links die in time due to pay per view, and, scholars or readers of Wiki must be provided with a choice, to read more meats or essential ingredients. Also, the libel suit was filed by Nograles, et al. and the subject is the naked run. Now Nograles withdrew due to affidavit of desistance, but, the other complainant did not, and the Court decided based on trial's evidence. So, with more reasons must the edit be there and at the very least, even a sentence, but the essentials of the naked run ought to be there.\nFinal point. I do not personally know Tinga, but in 1978, I hired a lawyer of Santiago, Tinga, Fornier Law Office, to handle my simple Malolos case. Tinga became congressman and had been well known for this controversy, it is of judicial notice in IBP. Personally, I ignored these, until Douglas Anama, my text mate, the husband of Felipa Borlongan Anama, our Assistant Clerk of the Supreme Court (with the equivalent salary and rank of CA Justice) repeatedly approached me to consult dwarves, due to their case which Tinga decided against him, that's his family home. Tinga is not the only one who had these bribery things; Ynares-Santiago and M. Nazario (remember the Ramos notable contempt fine) shared the pie. My point is - the Court would instead put to rest the issue by fine or contempt. But for us editors, we just follow the pattern in USA bio of senators and public figures. Hence, my edit is well copy pasted from Wikipedia good articles on sub-section controversies. But of course, with all due respect to your edits. Sorry, for my TLDR, but it is so informative. Cheers.   \n\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no_no_no_no_no_no"}

{"prompt":"\"\n\nFine, but keep in mind that this is not solely a matter of being NPOV- this is also a matter of accuracy.  The Eastern Catholic Churches that are in communion with the Vatican are not properly referred to by the term \"\"Roman Catholic Chruch\"\"- only those who practice the Latin or Western Rite are.  Take a look at this FAQ on Eastern Catholiscim to see how the term is properly used: .  The only truely accurate way to refer to the church headed by the Vatican is the Catholic Church, and if referring to this church with this title is NPOV, then there is no way that this article can be NPOV and use these terms as accurate as possible.\nI was aware that \"\"Catholic\"\" also means universal and is a Mark of the Church- I have to admit that I was not aware that other sects of Christianity use the word \"\"Catholic\"\" in their names.  It is for this reason alone that perhaps there is no really satisfactory way to resolve this issue, and perhaps it is truly best to incorrectly use the term \"\"Roman Catholic Church\"\" to refer to the entire church that is in communion with the Vatican.  I guess in the end it just doesn't matter, so I probably won't press the point any further.\nI still have to ask: \"\"Apostolic\"\" is another Mark of the Church.

{"prompt":"\"\nThe figure used on this page isn't the number of people who self-identify as \"\"Black\"\", it's the estimated number of people with some degree of African ancestry... in Latin America in general and Venezuela in particular these are very different things - \"\"black\"\" only applies to people who have sole or predominately African ancestry, while people of mixed ancestry generally consider themselves \"\"Brown\"\" (\"\"Moreno\"\") on the census (presumably this is what you are calling \"\"mestizo\"\"). If we simply used the \"\"Black\"\" figure from the census we'd be ignoring the large number of people who have mixed African and European\/Native American ancestry. We can't use the \"\"Brown\"\" figure either, as this would include many people who have both European and Native American ancestry but no African ancestry. So the census figures are no good for us and we need to find a different source that estimates African ancestry directly without using the \"\"black\"\"\/\"\"brown\"\" colour labels. The 20-30% estimation comes from an official document from the Venezuelan government (the Embassy in the US) which specifically states this as the number of people with African ancestry, so is a reliable source for our purposes. If you have an equal or better reliable source that gives an alternative figure then please let me know what it is. \nThe 100% issue is a red herring - \"\"mestizo\"\" and \"\"African ancestry\"\" are overlapping categories and can't be added together as if they were distinct... \"\"mestizo\"\" in Venezuela means a mixture of European, Native American and\/or African ancestry, so some of the people included in \"\"mestizo\"\" are also included in \"\"African ancestry\"\" and you'd be counting them twice if you added the two together. A better check is that we'd expect \"\"Afican ancestry\"\" to be all of the \"\"Black\"\" category plus part of the \"\"Brown\"\" category, so more than 3% and less than 53% - the 20-30% estimate fits this perfectly.\n  \"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no_no_no_no_no_no"}

For example, as a expert on the history of technology, I would prefer more treatment of that topic in this article, but I also concede that history of technology is a rather dry subject for most people and therefore I'm satisfied with the brief mention and links it gets.

The two other links worked fine, but you deleted them as well in your hurry to smash everything someone else did. In other words, you are the one who jumped to conclusions. Now you're trying to claim you only deleted the one that was a problem. Even your edit summary is wrong.

{"prompt":"\"\n\nHello NickCT  Could you please describe where synthesis is occurring  that is, can you show where the article is \"\"combining material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources\"\"? Could you please describe what you think is a violation of WP:POV? WP:COATRACK is an essay, not a policy, so COATRACK issues are a matter of personal opinion, not of policy.\nA few points regarding deletion:\n There are several books, journal articles, chapters of bioethics textbooks, etc. that have been written specifically on the topic of this article (unethical, nonconsensual, and\/or illegal medical experiments in the U.S.). They clearly separate this topic from that of human subject research in the United States in general.\n There exist articles for several other nations that are similar to this one, such as Nazi human experimentation, North Korean human experimentation, Japanese human experimentation. They exist for the same reason that this one should exist  numerous high-quality reliable sources have identified these topics as worthy of study in themselves.\n A wide array of reliable sources have identified this article's topic as worthy of standing alone as an object of analysis, separate from the broader history of human subject research in general. Per WP:NOTABLE that means that the topic of this article is worth of its own article. Just because many of the experiments in this article are things that most people would consider \"\"bad\"\" (which is why most medical ethics textbooks generally use them as illustrations of \"\"bad science\"\") does not mean that it is \"\"biased\"\" to have an article on them. WP:NPOV does not say that articles can't be about \"\"bad things\"\". It says that we should neutrally report what reliable sources have to say about things, regardless of our moral\/ethical views on them. This article neutrally reports what medical ethics texts, and histories of this topic have to say about it. I am not aware of anywhere in the article where it is not neutrally reporting what reliable sources are saying. \nThat said, like all articles, this article is an incomplete work in progress, so there are certainly issues. Rather than merely citing policy without reference to this article, please make specific suggestions for how to improve this article.  \"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no_no_no_no_no_no"}

For One America News Network ,  if you have such sources, it may be possible to rewrite the article; otherwise,  it will not be possible until such sources are published. \n \nAs you expand the article, remember that a Wikipedia article  needs to be written like an encyclopedia article, not a press releasedon't praise the organization or person, say what they do Don't include material that would better belong in an advertisement or a web page, such as a detailed list of products or of executives or branch offices.Remember not to  copy from a web site, even your own  first it's a copyright violation, but, even if you own the copyright and are willing to give us permission according to WP:DCM (permission that irrevocably gives everyone in the world the right to copy, reuse, and modify the material) , the tone will not be encyclopedic and the material will not be suitable. (Thus, there is generally no purpose in giving permission; it is better to rewrite.) \n\nInclude only material that would be of interest to a general reader coming across the mention of the subject and wanting the sort of information that would be found in an encyclopedia. Do not include material that would be of interest only to those associated with the subject, or to prospective clients\/purchasers\/students\/supporters\/donorsthat sort of content is considered promotional. \n\nAs reviewing administrator,  I removed the prod tag and placed an \"\"underconstruction\"\" tag on the article which should give you a few days to find sources before it gets listed for deletion. If you find you can't do it yet   you can facilitate matters by placing at the top a line reading  {{db-author}}, and it will be quickly deleted..

{"prompt":"\"\n\nI think there is possibly scope for a separate article.  For most applications of tensors to engineering (e.g., rigid body dynamics and stress analysis), it is not necessary to accommodate the general coordinate systems of tensor calculus.  Usually there is some fixed background frame and at worst one needs to know how things transform when that frame is rotated.  Then raising and lowering of indices is also not required, and all of the tensoriality is essentially quite trivial (so suitable for engineers).  It seems to me that this is the intended scope of the article, but it might be helpful if it stated this plainly somewhere, although it is possible that I might have misunderstood what is meant by \"\"rectangular coordinate system\"\".\n\nBut assuming that the tensoriality of things is supposed to be trivial here, then the article should not dwell too much on this aspect of things (as it presently does).  The likely audience of the article will only get confused by this, and those looking for a more comprehensive treatment of tensors have other articles to select from.  I think some time should be devoted to discussing examples.  A good one is the inertia tensor and Sylvester's law, in my opinion, because it's very easy to visualize (for instance, in terms of a spinning plate or something).    \"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no_no_no_no_no_no"}
