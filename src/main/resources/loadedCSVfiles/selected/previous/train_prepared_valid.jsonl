You also failed to provide diffs in your message to me, in regards to which words you're claiming are offesive, perhaps WP:Assume good faith.\n\nThe two users constantly harass and follow me to articles making disruptive edits in violation of numerous Wikipedia guidelines (WP:HARASS is just one). For example the removal of third party references from articles which don't suit their POV, without entering an edit summary (considered by Wikipedia guidelines as bad faith and a violation of WP:BLANK). The violation of WP:NEO by adding derogatory neologisms to the articles of organisations who they do not personally agree with, despite being made aware of the policy, despite not having any reference to the said organisation being described with said neologislm and despite the community majority constantly removing the derogatory term.  The same \"\"tag team\"\" practise can be shown to be used against numerous other editors who edit articles on British culture and trad counties, not just against me. Again, if you would like evidence just ask.\n\nIt would seem however, looking at the messages on your talkpage above, especially the lovely intertude under \"\"UK mediation\"\" section, that Jza messaged you (somebody he seems very familiar with) in violation of WP:CANVAS.

{"prompt":"\"\n\nI feel bad, too, JG. I know I can have a real smart, sarcastic mouth when I get totally frustrated, and when it gets going, look out! I apologize... Seriously. I don't want bad blood between us.\n\nI do have a POV, of course. We all do. But in an entry that is explaining the traditionalist POV (where there is \"\"the\"\" trad POV), it matches. And when it comes to external links\/further reading (not \"\"sources\"\"), then traditionalist websites deserve to be represented as much as others. I mean, on a page on Hannukah, there might be a link to \"\"An Orthodox Hannukah\"\" or \"\"Reformed Readings for Hannukah,\"\" but with Dominick it seems to be only his way or no way. He can't add a link for balance, or add \"\"a traditional Catholic site\"\" tag, or group links under headings as you did; he removes and replaces and mischaracterizes in the edit summaries.\n\nI am totally fine with any links to my site being labelled \"\"a traditional Catholic site\"\" or what not (though I think the same thing ought to work in the other direction such that EWTN, for ex., is labelled a \"\"conservative\"\" or \"\"neo-conservative\"\" site  not that I am worked up about going through Wiki and making it so, but the point remains). \n\nI'm glad you liked at least most of the page on the Rosary! (I think if you looked at the links mentioned in my RfC, you will actually like them, too  at least most of them. Seriously, check this section of the site out, and the sub-sections inside of it, like the \"\"Customs of the Liturgical Year\"\" section. There is nothing like it out there on the Net, and I'm not finished yet!) But your words show the key differences between traditionalists and conservatives\/neo-conservatives: you use the phrase \"\"attacks on Pope John Paul II\"\" with regard to the footnote about trads' opinions that changing the Mysteries of the Rosary was unwise, but we don't see it as an \"\"attack\"\" but a criticism. Even St. Paul himself resisted St. Peter, our first Pope, \"\"to the face\"\" when His Holiness did an unwise thing (Galatians 2), and St. Catherine of Siena used to write letters to the Pope, basically telling him to act like a man LOL Our differences pretty much come down to different understandings of infallibility, to perceptions of our ability to criticize and resist prudential, pastoral decisions, and to our different notions of Christian obedience (and here different trads have different opinions as to what should be obeyed or rightfully resisted, because that is a prudential concern in itself, one that each Catholic has to study and pray about).\n\nBut no matter whether you and Dominick and I agree or not (we don't have to agree to be decent to each other, and some of my favorite people are conservative Catholics!), there is a trad \"\"movement\"\" out there, and we have as much \"\"right\"\" to be heard as anyone else. Or imagine that we're not even Catholic at all and there's a page on the Rosary: no one would remove a link to \"\"Anglican Rosary practices.\"\" I just feel as if the traditional viewpoint is being censored, and it frustrates me (it doubly frustrates me when links like this aren't only removed, but are labelled \"\"blog\"\" or \"\"[[monograph|monographs]\"\". It's beyond belief, really, that he is allowed to get away with it).\n\nI will promise you this: from here on out, if I add any links to the site (only on relevant pages, of course), I will use the word \"\"a traditional Catholic site\"\" or some such after it, or will group links so that the fact that it is a trad site is clear. If I come across any older links that have already been added (and not all have been added by me, BTW), I will edit to do the same. Sound good? \n\nI am glad you wrote; I feel TONS better already...  \"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no"}

It is stated that CGC grades material from 0.5 to 10, then Definitions defines what A, P, S, M and E denote, but below that is given an example grading \"\"VF\/NM 9.0\"\". I'm going to induce that NM is near mint, but am I to guess what VF is or why it is there? 121.45.247.24  \n\nGood point. The numbers correspond to more traditional descriptive grades such as \"\"fine\"\", \"\"very fine\"\", \"\"near mint\"\", and \"\"mint\"\". I've added a sentence explaining that and a link to the chart on their website. Also, I removed the \"\"VF\/NM\"\" part from the example. Does that make it more comprehensible?   \n\n Missing an obvious and major criticism \n\nOne of the most obvious criticisms is that the CGC practice is the ultimate objectification and de-artification of the comic\/magazine being graded, because it is sealed permanently and will never be read\/viewed again except for the cover.

Comments made in an argumentative tone and accusations of sockpuppetry do not help to resolve it. I don't think the quote would be such an issue if the rest of the article was fuller, but when Berhalter's international career is summed up in three lines it comes across as undue weight. That an athlete shows confidence in the run up to a major tournament is not surprising, the key is the context in which such a quote is used. As the article stands now, the reader is not given any information about Berhalter's role at the 2006 World Cup other than stating that he was an addition to the squad. Appending the quote to this gives the impression that it was one of the defining moments of his career. As Berhalter was a substitute in all three games, and did not take to the field at any point in the tournament, this is clearly not the case. Perhaps it could be referenced in a sentence such as \"\"Berhalter expressed confidence in the ability of the USA team in run up to the tournament,Czechs and balances: US foe able, aching, The Boston Globe, June 12, 2006 but was an unused substitute in all three group games.

{"prompt":"\"\n\nWell, I said I am flexible, but I think you are way out of line with the article. For a long time the article stood on its legs because I, as Entwistle's biographer (the book is on its way), VERIFIED the sources. For example (and I'm only going to give two for now), you deleted the entry mentioning her signing the RKO contract on June 13....I HAVE THE CONTRACT IN FRONT OF ME! I'd be happy to send you a scan of it. At the top it says, \"\"This agreement made this 13th Day of June, 1932, between RKO Studios and Peg Entwistle.\"\" It is signed by Entwistle, David O. Selznick, and Daniel L. Oshea, Selnick's Assistant Secretary. Then you added that Entwistle played in bit parts in several films (I'm paraphrasing), and referenced a source. But this claim of bit parts in other films proved to be untrue when I researched the entire body of RKO's inter-office memos at the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences archives in the Herrick Library in Beverly Hills. (I have copies of all the Selznick and Cukor memos regarding \"\"Thirteen Women,\"\" and other possible Peg Entwistle-related projects (such as discussions regarding Billie Burke wanting Peg instead of Katherine Hepburn in \"\"Bill of Divorcement.\"\" (Would you like to see them, too?)\n\nI can go on and on with your deletionswhich, in my opinion, have a somewhat thinly-veiled personal bent. Clearly, you have no idea what you are talking about with regard to much of what you \"\"tweaked.\"\" I understand editing for flow and NPOV, but your scalpel became a chainsaw to an article, though far from perfect, was quite acceptable to long-time Wiki editors and other administrators.\nI tried to be polite and respectful and reasonable, but it turns out that you are entirely unwilling to discuss anything with regard my expertise into the career and life and death of Peg Entwistle before \"\"tweaking\"\" her Wiki.\n\nEntwistle's familynamely her brother Milton Entwistle and his daughterfurnished me with hundreds of documents including diaries, letters, and telegrams. Before I met them I spent 5 years researching her careerliterally reading the era's newspapers and theatrical-related periodicals a page at a time. I spent hundreds of hours doing interviews. I found Entwistle doing radio in 1925, having lunch at the White House in 1931, being black mailed, and a dozen other things no onenot even her family had known. And because of her family's cooperation, I was able to complete a timeline that other authors had never before been able to string together. EVERYTHING I discovered has at least two verifiable, reliable sources.\n\nWiki editors Rossrs, and Wildhartlivie, and I spent weeks \"\"tweaking\"\" the  Entwistle articleit wasn't perfect, but it was good enough for them and so it remained good enough for Wikipedia until you came along and decided you knew more about her than her biographer. How ironic that a Wikipedia Administrator, in trying to establish a foothold of \"\"one-up-menship\"\" into a long-accepted Wikipedia article, actually deleted facts and added untruthsI'm sure you're quite satisfied with yourself.  \"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no"}

{"prompt":"Sure. First I'm not Chomsky or Finkelstein but their POV is similar to mine on many issues. But to explain my POVand I hope I'm logicalI'm against all States. I'm not an anarchist, either; I see States as a necessary evil given the current state of human civilization. But they should not be glorified as a an end, but as a means to an end, the end being peace, security for ALL, democracy, people before profits, equality ect (progressive values). \n\nStates should never be supported when they rest on the oppresssion of others. I oppose all conquest and imperialism, past and present. As far as states created by conquest, what is important is current oppression, i.e.  ending it,(esp. state-sponsored) that are in the bussiness of building based on conquest of others. This must be opposed equally in all cases, which a special responsiblity for those you can have the greatest effect in changing, stoping, i.e. if I live in the US, I have a special responsiblity to speak out against things this countries does (directly or indirectly as in the case of support for Israeli occupation).\n\nAs for the meaning of a national homeland, it could mean the country of origin and native land of a people who have a strong cultural connection and history within such a territory , a cultural geography. There are many ethnic groups who holds a long history and a deep cultural association different country or geographical regions, in particular where the national identity began. And, diffferent groups can live in peace side to side, with different language, cultures, co-existing with the same country, united under the common accepted cultural norms of democratic values. This does not negate a national homeland, only having it based on the oppression of others. Hence, I'm able to be for a national homeland for the Jewish people in the land of Israel while at the same time I'm anti-Zionist and advocate for a binational state.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no"}

{"prompt":"What Britannica says about the early populations of the area \n\nMacedonia: History – Encyclopaedia Britannica\n\nMacedonia owes its name to the ancient kingdom of Macedonia (or Macedon). Centred in the southern part of the region, (i.e. present-day Northern Greece) this kingdom seems to have been largely Greek-speaking, with Thracian and Illyrian admixtures. By the 4th century bc, it had extended its rule northward into the Balkan Peninsula and throughout the Mediterranean. In the 2nd century bc, Macedonia was made into a Roman province. When the Roman Empire was divided in the 4th century ad into eastern and western halves, Macedonia became part of the eastern half, which became the Byzantine Empire. By this time the population of Macedonia had been largely Christianized. Macedonia’s Greek ethnic composition was overturned by the invasion of Slavic peoples into the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries AD.\n\nPaionia (historical region) – Encyclopaedia Britannica\n\nPaeonia,  the land of the Paeonians, originally including the whole Axius (Vardar) River valley and the surrounding areas, in what is now northern Greece, (Republic of) Macedonia, and western Bulgaria. The Paeonians, who were probably of mixed Thraco-Illyrian origin, were weakened by the Persian invasion (490 bc), and those tribes living along the Strymon River (in western Bulgaria) fell under Thracian control. The growth of Macedonia forced the remaining Paeonians northward, and in 358 bc they were defeated by Philip II of Macedonia. The native dynasty, however, continued to be highly respected: about 289 bc, King Audoleon received Athenian citizenship, and his daughter married Pyrrhus, king of Epirus. Under the Romans, Paeonia was included in the second and third districts of the province of Macedonia. By ad 400, however, the Paeonians had lost their identity, and Paeonia was merely a geographic term\n\nIt is incorrect to citing Britannica in this article biased, i.e. only the article about the history of the are, which is today Northern Greece, ignoring the article, which points to the history of today R. of Macedonia (Paionia).\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no"}

{"prompt":"\":::Gosh, if you want to add a comparison, go ahead and do it! I'm not stopping you. I never said it was wrong to add a comparison.\n\nHere is a featured article about a Candide that uses the Further reading section just the way it is used here. Actually, there are two books in that section. There are also a few relevant academic articles and all the remaining relevant reviews that were published in English.\n\nAbout the Einsaztgruppen, you should go back to the wiki article you tried to use against me and read it again. Nowhere it says that they were under orders of the Wehrmacht, but that they were in close cooperation. I'll quote it for you: Each Einsatzgruppe was led by SD, Gestapo and Kripo officers, and its members included recruits from the Orpo, the Waffen-SS, and local volunteers, such as militia groups. Each death squad followed the Wehrmacht Heer (German Army) as it advanced eastwards through Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. During the course of their operations, the Einsatzgruppen commanders were authorized to request, and did receive, assistance from the Wehrmacht. Heydrich acted under orders from Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler who supplied security forces on an \"\"as needed\"\" basis to the local SS and Police Leaders. They were different organizations. The Wehrmacht could not give order to the SS. Again, from that article: The Einsatzgruppen were formed under the direction of SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich (deputy to Heinrich Himmler) and operated by the Schutzstaffel (SS) before and during World War II. From September 1939 forward the SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA – Reich Main Security Office)[4] had overall command of the Einsatzgruppen.\n\nWhat Littell does is to make the picture unclear by saying that the Wehrmacht worked too closely with the Einsaztgruppen. The following passage is singular in that respect: “I don’t understand. Who should we take our orders from, in the end? From Reichenau or Jeckeln? And where is Brigadeführer Rasch?”—“I don’t know, Sturmbannführer.”. I suggest changing \"\"attached\"\" to \"\"worked closely with\"\", \"\"cooperated\"\" or something like that.\n\nAs for the sentence the Sixth Army, the AOK 6, to which we were attached, Littell originally used the verb \"\"rattacher\"\", auquel nous étions rattachés, which is usually translated as \"\"linked\"\", \"\"connected\"\" or \"\"associated\"\". By translating it to \"\"attached\"\", it took away the double entendre in Littell original text.\n\nUnfortunately, we'll have to disagree about the image.   \n\n\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no"}

Secondly, Schindler's heroism is widely recognized all over the world, while Winton is mostly known by the British who are extremely well-known for loudly bragging about things they never accomplished. He is a purely media-made hero. And third of all, the children he saved were thrown out of their homes in Britain as soon as the war ended. And judging by the numerous published cases of abuse of evacuated British children in their adoptive homes, how those Czechoslovakian children were treated in their British homes would be an interesting investigation.

{"prompt":"\"This lowly editor thinks not. There is a perennial dispute on the table here. Egoistic vs. Non-Egoistic concerns, viz. Self vs. Non-Self concerns. Individual v. Social concerns. Libertarianism is a celebration of the ego isn't it? And by \"\"ego\"\" I mean self. From the self comes liberty. From the ego comes identity, etcetera etcetera. Socialism? That seems to me to be all about the NON-EGO. Freedom itself is derived from man. I know we're just a lowly democratic encyclopedia, and are prohibited from doing Original Research, but seriously guys, WAKE UP. Are Libertarians socialists? Isn't that like, the diametric opposite of libertarianism? I, for one, am not a big fan of submitting to the needs of the state or \"\"the people\"\". From socialism, I see, comes anarchism, viz. the propagation of herding behavior amongst humans. Viz., the abdication of a centralized authority. If there is no centralized authority, who controls the state of things? A dictator, that's who. Take North Korea for example. Or the former USSR, or Nazi Germany. All of these states are self-proclaimed socialists. Are libertarians socialists? I think not (Thomas Jefferson). Again, guys\/girls, I'm just making an appeal to LOGIC, not AUTHORITY. This particular Wikipedia article rides a fence. Thoughts? Please do not remove this writing. I will re-establish it. I am simply trying to create a dialogue. Does libertarianism have ANYTHING to do with socialism? Because socialism, it seems, begs for anarchy-and anarchy, as it were, is a pre-requisite for dictatorship. Libertarians are the opposite of dictators, we are individuals...socialists are non-individuals, ideologically speaking. There is a tremendous amount of confusion, and out of this confusion comes intrepid leaders. I am an \"\"Anarch\"\", but I do not believe in Anarchy. Does that make any sense?

{"prompt":"\"\n\nI agree with most of what you said about Chicago.  In fact, I've always said that Chicago was more conservative than a lot of smaller cities in the Great Lakes region (namely Cleveland, Detroit and Milwaukee) if for no other reason than a larger percentage of people who fit into one or more of the categories you named (person of color, union worker, \"\"lakefront liberal,\"\" and I would add bohemian\/counter-culturist to the list as well).  \n\nHowever, I don't think that's enough to say it couldn't count as a \"\"third coast.\"\" New York has a republican mayor and California has a republican governor, so it's pretty obvious that the \"\"first\"\" and \"\"second\"\" coasts have their conservative segments as well.  As far as Chicago culture being bland compared to the East and West coasts, you're probably right about that too.  But it's not as if people on the east or west coast don't have their criticism about the other coasts' culture as well.  East Coast people tend to think West Coast culture is too fluffy and superficial and West Coast people think the East Coast is too uptight and high-strung.  So I don't think how Chicago\/Great Lakes culture is viewed by people on the coasts shoould really have any bearing on whether or not it's a \"\"coast.\"\"\n\nBesides, I don't think the purpose is to compare the Great Lakes to the Eastern or Western seaboards.  I think its purpose is more to differentiate the major urban centers of the Great Lakes from the Midwest at large (which is seen as mostly small-town and conservative).  And I don't think you can disagree that when compared to the rest of their states that places like Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee do seem like \"\"ultra-urban\"\" and \"\"ultra-liberal\"\" oasises.  \"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no"}

Please see the section immediately above this article. Or better yet, spend the next 24 hours reading the first sections of Sein und Zeit and you will see the ridiculousness of the article as it currently stands, which demonstrates no understanding of Heidegger, and leaves everyone who reads it dumber than  when they began and knowing less about everything. This is so atrocious that essentially the entire article as it stands needs to be deleted and began again. I have no more time for this.   \n\nI tried to move the Dreyfus to the main article and now apparently all the material is destroyed. Do you have any comprehension of how bad this article currently is? One would have no idea that Heidegger was ever read anywhere outside of France from the current article. No summaries of Heidegger's important concepts are given. No understanding of any of Heidegger's ideas are conveyed. Since you have decided to destroy my work, you can keep your poor article, which reads as if it was machine-translated from a foreign language. You do not even let someone in the middle of working finish before you destroy their work. No wonder zero academics contribute to this site and your articles are so atrocious. Anyone who reads the article as it currently stands comes away knowing less about Heidegger than they did before because of all of the obvious distortions and gross inaccuracies. You have not even succesfully explained a single one of Heidegger's terms or concepts here, or why anyone should care who he is. This article is an embarassment indeed.   \nWords are important rather than space on the screen because people have different size screens. I have a 27 inch screen and a 5 inch screen, both of which I edit on. The lead is the same amount of words on both screens, but not the same number of \"\"screens\"\" for two different users.

{"prompt":"\"\n\nIt's not really an abbreviation in the sense you mean; it's two words combined to make a new name. In that sense, it just becomes a proper noun. The thing with \"\"forex\"\" is that it actually refers to \"\"foreign exchange\"\", and is thus an abbreviation, whereas \"\"Pasmo\"\" is simply the name of something (and the etymology is not crucial to its function as such).\n\nAnd even if you insist that it's an abbreviation, there's still no reason for it to appear in all-caps. The forex page on Wikipedia doesn't even use all-caps for \"\"forex,\"\" so that kind of dumps your argument (not to be rude, but this is the case: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Forex).\n\nAlso note that EBay, when refering to itself (on its website and in reports, etc.), starts sentences with \"\"eBay,\"\" but the Wall Street Journal quite rightly follows convention and begins such sentences with \"\"EBay.\"\"\n\nI find the trend of using all-caps when there is no basis for doing so highly annoying.

Wikipedia does not have to support the company's misguided use of SHOUTING (which is (and this is an unverifiable statement based on experience) probably due to a lack of understanding of English style conventions—or a refusal to accept them, even after they have been explained—rather than due to an informed decision based on whether the name constitutes an acronym\/abbreviation or not).

The much vaunted CDC source made it sound even less ambigous. Her very own source backed me! That TG\/TS women are for the CDC's and any other medical purpose biologically male, that the MSM category does not take into account any aspec of identity. Which would include gender identity. Case closed.\n\nThe rest of this has just been about Puella and her personal feelings.   \n\nNo, my source states that gender identity is not tracked at all, so the assumption on their part is that everyone is reported as they \"\"biological\"\" sex.  However, again, if a TS\/TG were reported as female, since no gender identity information would be collected there would be no indication of which were which.  Literally TS\/TG information is entirely intermingled, in some indeterminable amount.  The ambiguity of not collecting TS\/TG information means that there is simply a blanket assumption about how the information is received from the CDC... the true answer is, because of the ambiguity no one knows how they're split up... the data is intermingled, and there is no way to separate the information.  Again, the answer from the CDC and from your sources is that the assumption is that MTF TS\/TG are reported as MSM, and FTM are just pretty much ignored... N.B. assumption... since gender identity information isn't collected no one can say what it is.  Again, being that my medical records indicate me as female, and I continue to be asked \"\"are you pregnant?\"\" when getting x-rays indicates that I would not be reported as a male to the CDC.  Without collecting gender identity information, no one can with certainty that all TS\/TG are recorded as MSM.

Yes, I've done a lot of work there, but am tightly constrained in how much I can reveal regarding the sources of any so-called \"\"original research\"\" material. Suffice it to say that I was privileged to work in the Dept of Physics at Auckland University (NZ), aged 19, as a research assistant (40+ years ago), where I made friends with a few young doctoral students, one of whom was researching gravitational waves. I then studied physics at the University of Canterbury, under Prof. Roy Kerr, the rotating black hole theorist. I've kept in touch with a few of those guys over the years, and they've introduced me to certain other \"\"big names\"\" in physics. I bailed out of the academy before gaining a doctorate, preferring a broad interdisciplinary education, and disgusted by the stress, pressure, politics, and the close-minded arrogance of certain professional academics. I had a fun life instead, and followed my curiosity about gravitation, astrophysics and cosmology in a totally relaxed way. Over the past decade or so, I've been privy to hearing about some very exciting developments in theoretical physics, particularly with regards to the unification problem. I can't say too much, because *cough* Nobel *cough*. If, just saying, somebody (hypothetically) had actually nailed the spin-2 boson, but hadn't yet published anything until it's mathematically robust, peer-reviewed, etc, then it's (hypothetically) highly likely that the solution would involve a mathematical toolkit comprising complex dimensional analysis, multi-dimensional special & general relativity, loop quantum gravity, E8 Theory, etc. Just wildly speculating here, but it's the 100th anniversary of Einstein's publication of GR — could be a very big year for physics.

Nevertheless it is also highly relevant to any rational discussion about this aspect of the Jewish law, and for that reason should remain.\n\nIf other contributors wish to argue that Jeremiah's comment about scribal ethics is not relevant to Biblical passages about circumcision, they are welcome to demonstrate this.

Either way, Ryan wasn't necessarily lying and a more fitting title may be a good idea.\n\n Emo \n\nThis band has emo lyrics, that should be stated somewhere in the article, I would add it myself but I'm probably going to get RV by some sensitive fan. \n\nPunk-Pop\nPunk Revival\nEmo\n\nAre SUGGESTED STYLES from allguide.com\n\nThe term \"\"emo\"\" is thrown around so loosly and it's become a label that bands and other people see to be offended by, I don't think that it's necessary to state that in the article, especially since \"\"emo\"\" has no real definition in the first place.\n\n Former Band Members Section? \n\nDo any of you think that someone should add a section specifically for \"\"Former Members\"\" and then talk about the controversy involving whether the bass lines in the album were actually his or not? I don't like the fact that it's just bunched in with the current members with no explaination on the dismissal. \n\n Wikiproject proposal \n\nI've proposed a Panic! at the Disco Wikiproject here, to see how many people would be interested before starting one. The project would be an effort by a group of Wikipedians to build and improve all Panic! at the Disco pages (including members of the band, songs and albums). If you think that you'd be reguarly editing these pages, please put your name down at this page so we can see who would be interested in the project. Thanks in advance- '  talk |  \n\nmany people believe that the band members may be homosexuals but as they said in one of there interviews on absoluterock they said they confirmed \"\"none of the band members are gay not that theres anything wrong with it\"\"-ryan ross\n\n\"\"emo\"\"\n\nWouldn't things just be alot easier if people could all just agree on Panic! being emo? \"\"Emo\"\" is basically this generation's \"\"grunge\"\". Sure, the bands may not sound very similar to each other at all, but did Nirvana sound similar to Pearl Jam? No, not really. So just because Panic! and say, My Chemical Romance might not sound exactly similar that doesn't mean they can't be the same genre. And guess what- just because \"\"emo\"\" bands hate being called that doesn't mean anything. \"\"Grunge\"\" bands hated being called grunge too. \n\nAnd there definetly IS an emo sound. There's definetly a particular vocal style, lyrical style, and attitude that emo bands have.\n\nAgreed, Panic! is an emo band, but many fans here seem to have a problem with that. \n\nA lot of people get really sensitive about things they like being labelled emo, I think it's just because the stereotypical emo isn't really something that a lot of people want to be associated with. I agree that the vocal style especially is emo, and the way they look is also associated with emo- not all songs, but some songs of theirs have 'emo-ish' lyrics, too. I'm fine with the genre being changed, it's just a matter of fans researching them here and becoming offended- instead of discussing it here, it's going to be changed back a lot. However, on the page it's set as emo and alternative rock, which is perfect. '  talk |  \n\n Early 2007 album \n\nIt says their new album will be ready for compalation in early 2007, that's not true in Rolling Stone Ryan says He plans to write\/ record the album during the summer of 2007 and release it during the fall of 2007. I would add it but i've never done anything like that before so I figured i'd just put it in here. http:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/news\/coverstory\/panic_at_the_disco_high_school_musical?source=panicatthedisco_rssfeed That's the link to the rolling stone thing by the way.\n\n Panic and FOB..... together? \n\n       I've been liking Fall Out Boy and Panic since last June.

Your friend the Hillman agent seems to be MIA, so I'll be waiting until he\/she\/it gets back to renew my discussions with him\/her\/it. But as it happens, I just noticed that you responded to me in the CTMU AfD as follows:\n \n\"\"The only kind of theory capable of 'resolving an intractable paradox of physical science' is a theory formulated on a level above that of the paradox itself; thus, using the theory, one can define a function which resolves the paradox by mapping its (otherwise conflicting) elements consistently into observables. [That was me; now here's you:] WP:BOLLOCKS. Well, perhaps, not, but no such (intractable) paradox is discussed here. — Arthur Rubin | (talk) .\"\" \n\nI'm very sorry that I wasn't able to respond to you when you made that comment - too much going on for me to notice it at the time, I'm afraid. But now that it has come to my attention, I'm struck by its ambiguity. Do you mean that science generates no intractable paradoxes in the conventional or computational sense? (If so, I'd like to know how you've managed to deduce this.) Do you mean that such paradoxes may in fact exist, but that the resolutions are necessarily scientific as opposed to interpretative? (If so, I'd again like to know your reasoning.) Or do you simply mean that the CTMU - an unquestionably notable theory which was covered by large-circulation elements of the popular media, but whose Wikipedia article you nevertheless helped to delete - doesn't have anything to do with such paradoxes? \n\nI ask, of course, because you are a \"\"relatively famous Wikipedian\"\" who participated in getting that article deleted, and as an important mathematician, must understand quite a bit indeed! More importantly, because you have taken it upon yourself to help arbit the math-science-pseudomath\/science-philosophy distinction here at Wikipedia, I think we all need to make sure that you thoroughly understand it, and are not letting misconceptions contribute to possible conflicts of interest on the parts of other Wikipedians.

It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of:\n1.

The Wikipedia Ambassador Program is currently looking for Campus Ambassadors to help with Wikipedia assignments at Louisiana State University, which will be participating in the Public Policy Initiative for the Spring 2011 semester.  The role of Campus Ambassadors will be to provide face-to-face training and support for students on Wikipedia-related skills (how to edit articles, how to add references, etc.). This includes doing in-class presentations, running workshops and labs, possibly holding office hours, and in general providing in-person mentorship for students.\n\nPrior Wikipedia skills are not required for the role, as training will be provided for all Campus Ambassadors (although, of course, being an experienced editor is a plus).\n\nIf you live near Baton Rouge and you are interested in being a Wikipedia Campus Ambassador, or know someone else from the area who might be, please email me or leave a message on my talk page.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no"}

I was a physics major in a major university for a couple years, eventually broadened out to other things, but I can still read Pauli and Reichenbach without feeling that I got caught in the spin cycle of a rug washer. The same isn't true of the Wikipedia physics articles.\n\nI've tried to clear up the philosophy of QM article that is under rfd, but Mr. Ingham has not answered my questions about what he is trying to say in a responsive way. The \"\"simplified\"\" article looks like a better place to start.\n\nMy experience in physics at the University level may be relevant. We had a trimester system. The first trimester was mechanics. I did o.k., but calculus was new to me. The second semester was electricity. Since I had shocked myself working on old radios, made crystal radios, etc., etc. for years, I already knew what was going on. In some ways I was ahead of our grad student lab leader, who couldn't understand why putting one probe of a volt meter into the DC outlet on the lab bench did not produce a reading. My grade jumped to A, not because I was any smarter, but because I knew from experience what happens when resistors are wired in series and when they are wired in parallel, and to other students such matters were totally abstract. I think that students should begin with real-world experiences as much as possible. Unfortunately, many students live in very restricted environments.

{"prompt":"\"\n\nOppose - The current title is overwhelmingly preferred by the policy of using the most common name, and the manual of style specifically encourages editor discretion. The MOS is great for our writing style and when the official or common name might be unknown, but to argue that it should be used to take an official name with a specifically chosen title that is used by the absolutely overwhelming majority of reliable sources, including books, newspapers, and websites, as well as is the generally common name is fairly absurd. Our title guidelines and policies are unfortunately somewhat murky. But, what it comes down to can be gleaned from Wikipedia:Naming conventions (capitalization), which states that \"\"an adherence to conventions widely used in the genre are critically important to credibility\"\". If Billboard is using a style, and Rolling Stone or the New York Times or Spin or just the bulk of reliable sourcing in general largely use the official title, is it really common sense for us to be saying we shouldn't be following the sources here in order to somehow adhere to conventions and gain credibility? Wikipedia is a unique construct in that our work is so clearly tied and based off of reliable sourcing about the subject  making us stand out and go against the grain here just doesn't make much sense.There's also just the general notion (which certainly should not be the deciding factor in finding consensus) that certain lowercase words just look weird in titles. Perhaps this may give some indication as to why \"\"like\"\" and other 3 or more letter words are very often capitalized in composition titles but words like \"\"a\"\", \"\"to\"\", or \"\"and\"\" often aren't.

{"prompt":"\"\nNope.  The word \"\"hippie\"\" was in use before it referred to the hippie subculture.  Read Hippie (etymology).  Unless you can find a secondary source showing that the Rolling Stones were using it to refer to the subculture, then you don't have a dispute.  We don't do original research.  The Fallon citation isn't sourced to Fallon: it's found in multiple sources that make that claim.  Take a look at the citation in the Hippie article: Perry 2005, p. 19; Sinclair, Mick. (2004) San Francisco: A Cultural and Literary History. Signal Books. p. 205. ISBN 1902669649; Singleton, Carl. Wildin, Rowena. (1999). The Sixties in America. Salem Press. p. 334. ISBN 0893569828; Stevens 1998, pp. 299-300; Tompkins 2001, vol. 7: 1960-1969.  Now, all you have to do is find one that refers to the Rolling Stones.  The addition of McCleary's \"\"numerous theories abound as to the origin of this word\"\" is a great start in the right direction.  The next step is to find sources for additional theories.

{"prompt":"\"::::That's an interpretation. And state and nation are inseparable under the Spanish constitution (1978) that only accepts the term nation for Spain. \nWanting to keep Spain united is legitimate but, specially as this is done via denying the right of self-determination for minority nations such as the Basque one, it clearly is Spanish nationalism.\nPart of the problem may be that \"\"nationalist\"\" in Spanish has not the negative connotation that may have in English. Instead \"\"patriotic\"\" does have a negative connotation in Spanish that doesn't seem to have in English. They are sort of inverted in their shades. But basically they mean the same thing after all. \nNationalism is after all the ideology that supports the ambitions of certain nation (nation-state, stateless nation...), often at the expense of others. It's not very different from patriotism actually but somehow people seem to feel differently about these terms and the feelings are opposed in English and Spanish. In Spanish \"\"patria\"\" (fatherland), \"\"patriota\"\" and \"\"patriótico\"\" are part of the language of the Army, which is inherently associated to Francoism and other many military coups. Franco and his partisans abused these terms mercilessly, so Basque nationalists almost never call themselves \"\"patriotas\"\" in Spanish, even if that's the literal translation of \"\"abertzale\"\" but \"\"nationalists\"\". On the other hand Spanish nationalists (PP, PSOE, some minor parties) don't use either term normally but talk about the unity of Spain and not being nationalist (in the sense of stateless nations' patriots). \nAlso, back to the PSOE, they have a somewhat confuse discourse but, outside of Catalonia, they are clearly centralists. Navarrese PSN is as anti-Basque as UPN (PP). Western Basque PSE-EE is, despite its incorporation of the acronym EE, at most very limitedly regionalist. \nUnder PSOE governments transference of attributions as per the Gernika statute were frozen almost totally most of the time. Their discourse may be somewhat confuse but they are clearly against Basque self-determination and self-rule beyond what is almost unavoidable to keep some appearence of social peace. They are not as extremist or inflexible as PP maybe but that only makes them moderate Spanish nationalists, but Spanish nationalists anyhow. \nPSOE is also strongly in the Jacobinist tradition that all pan-French parties have. Yet the reality of Spain doesn't fit so well with those centralist premises and therefore an unstable arrangement had to be made. It was nevertheless more impelled by the extinct UCD of Suárez than by the PSOE itself. And it's understood by most that the coup of 1981 was a whistle blow, with the complicity of PSOE, against \"\"excessive\"\" decentralization that Suárez seemed willing to concede. \nWhatever the case, the term \"\"unionist\"\" seems to avoid all this problematic and is a good English term. I really can't find anything better. My POV is \"\"Spanish nationalist\"\" as more precise term, \"\"unionist\"\" is for me a linguistic compromise and also a step towards NPOV. \nI'd really like to hear from Mountolive.

The authors draw upon a wide literature and an impressive range of languages to present a clear and careful picture of a very complex period in Lao and Southeast Asian history.\n\nThis book is really the story of Chou Anou, the last of the Lao kings of Vientiane and his struggle against rivals on all sides. Chou Anou played a political game between the expansionist Thai and Vietnamese states in the late eighteenth and ear]y nineteenth centuries, a game that his kingdom eventually lost. Because of the Tay Son, Vietnam was out of the picture for decades; the central Thai court was Chou Anou's chief antagonist. When Vietnam does enter the picture again under Minh Mang, it is as a supporter of Chou Anou, in the context of a larger Thai-Vietnamese competitive hostility. Fighting between Thailand and Vientiane appears on an extremely personal level in the text — the authors stressing at one point Rama III's anxiety that a massacre of Vietnamese emissaries and Lao guides by a Thai officer had not left enough dead, considering an earlier massacre of Thai by Chou Anou in Vientiane (p. 242); they stress also the personal nature of the fighting between Chou Anou and the Thai general Bodin. Further, the text seems almost to replicate, anachronistically, aspects of war more endemic to the post-World-War II conflicts in Indochina, including a reference to \"\"sophisticated Siamese psychological operations\"\" (p. 212).\n\nPaths to Conflagration is organized into nine chapters, each covering a different episode of the period, examined step-by-step, and turns from one incarnation of Vientiane to another — from victim to provocateur to buffer state. Each page is heavy with documentation, but the narrative is lighter. This book has three real strengths. First, it discusses history at the point of intersection between three different polities and does not apply the nation-state \"\"cookie-cutter\"\" approach — looking only at developments as they relate to a state-centered narrative (thus framed by political borders). Instead of the history of Laos, we find here the history of a very turbulent period in which political borders did not mean very much in delineating the boundaries of action. Second, this book makes use of a very wide range of sources, especially from the Thai archives, spanning a large number of languages (including Lao, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, French, English, and German — both primary sources and secondary literature) and a multitude of perspectives. Third, this book focuses attention on developments sometimes left out of analyses of mainland Southeast Asian history, such as the all-important impact of migration, especially in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It is no mistake that migration is referred to over and over again in chronicles of the period, from western Burma to Vietnam, and that migration is used as metaphor for political change and state reformation for far earlier periods in these chronicles. Here too, migration played a very important role, as the authors stress both migration into the Lao kingdom, and forcible expulsion by the Thais, as a basis for the well-being and even survival of the Vientiane-based state.\n\n  \"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no"}

{"prompt":"Are you even listening to me? In 1838, the Armenian Oblast (Armenian province) population was numbering of about 165,000 people according to statistics, about half were Armenian(excluding the later 200,000 on its seroundings who later immigrated). In 1924 the population of Azerbaijan was of 2 million, 75% were Azeri Tartars, it compromised of Baku province , Elizavetpol Province and the adjoining districts, (including Nagorno Karabakh and Nakhochevan). From 250-300,000 Armenians were moved from Julfa, Erivan and Nakhichevan in 1604 and following, if you claim that there was even as much Muslim there, you are totally ignoring the history of the period. Since the partial control by the Ottoman, Nakhichevan and Erivan served as depots of goods, intermedary from the Ouest and East, Persia even further pushed that but replaced the Armenians who would rather trade on the Shah's capital. You claim having provided data, but you have provided absolutly nothing, because the only things you have provided, even before I covered them, and what you present in no way contradict what you claim. A projection of that much people (250-300,000), to claim that Tartars at least presented that much in the Western zone, would have been just sensless.\n\nWhat I have provided.\n\n1-That there were reasons specifically targetting Armenians which do not apply and were not applied to Muslims.\n\n2-I have provided materials excluding the Muslims in reference to the depopulation.\n\n3-I have provided materials equating the population with the word Armenian.\n\n4-I have provided a reference prior to Gultestan Treaty, and you dismissed the author, while in Wikipedia we only present sources and if there exist critics from notable published materials of those sources. What you think of the author is original research.\n\nYou answered by presenting 13-14th century and post Gulestan materials, which in no way have I contested nor do they contradict what I have been saying. I have provided figures of Armenian moved, which by projection represent 2 million or more Armenians if projected for 1918, and those excludes the recorded numbers of Armenians who escaped depopulation and inspite of it, there still remained a considerable number of Armenians pre Gulestan, which I also documented. I have documented everything I have been claiming, you request things that do not exist, because there was no Nakhochevan delimitation in that period, nor statistics for a bordering which is quite modern in comparaison to Abbas period.\n\nIn short, what you have highlighted is that the word Armenian has no place in this article, and that you have no intention to improve it. You know that what you propose is misleading but you still claim it is neutral. As we speak 98% of Nakhichevan population is Azeri, so claiming depopulation could only be misleading in that it suggest that Azeris were those moved when the Armenians were those mostly affected. Obviously here, we do have a problem, and as it appears, you in no way want to correct it.  (ix)\n\n###\n\n","completion":" no"}
