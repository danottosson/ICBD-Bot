Pschemp, Wikipedia's responsible for this libel, both here and in the discussion about it.  I don't see what I want about it either.  How a self-claimed, previously threatening, 18-year-old senior in high school can block a 42 y/o CEO of a fellow 501(c)(3) who's completed a graduate-level class in generative syntax (linguistics) and done a lot of work on an """"article"""" is beyond me.   even has a run-on sentence on his user page and very poor spelling all over the place, including there.  Whereas I got """"As"""" and """"Bs"""" in all 4-year-college English requirements for graduation with a 4-year degree, I have to get """"bullied"""" here to share ideas by someone with much less education and authority, not to mention get falsely accused of things.  My work brought the article up to a """"Start-Class"""" on the Wikipedia quality scale, and I'm the only one arguing who even claims to be a member of the Military history WikiProject, let alone a candidate for coordinator there.

I do feel defensive, and granted, Military history WikiProject coordinator would still not provide me with any executive powers.  However, it provides another reason for administrators to not want to block my account like they have, making false accusations, not even providing a warning, overstepping their authority, bullying.  It appears to be one of the many flaws on Wikipedia, flaws whose effects need much better mitigation or repair.  Hopefully, we'll manage it well, but we aren't right now; that's for sure!

There are too many lists in this article (see Wikipedia:WikiProject UK geography/How to write about settlements#Dos and Don'ts and WP:LISTS for guidelines.) The sections that need most attention are the ones listi8ng the civil parishes and the suburbs. I've done some minor editing of the civil parishes list (changed the entries to the official names, all of which have articles on here, even if they are stubs), and  I've removed all the redlinks in the list of suburbs and parts of Warrington.

 anti-Greek collusion occuring? 

I am new to Wikipedia. I've only been here a few days and I already get a strong sense of anti-Macedonian bias. (for the record when I say Macedonian... I'm talking about the ones that identify with Greece)

I've already been threatened with banning and named called on more than one occasion for simply discussing facts on Macedonia. At this point I am loathe to name more names but it always appears to be the same set of people working together as a team. (I'm sure you know who some of them are) 

Anyhow... I have an interesting image that I think this is very relevant to the naming dispute article but I don't know how to upload it. Perhaps you could arrange it? (they should be allowable under fair use) I think the second one down """"Solun will be the capital of Macedonia again""""... perfectly illustrates Greek claims of FYROM irredentist behavior and would be an excellent example to add to the naming dispute page.

http://history-of-macedonia.com/wordpress/category/fyrom-news/

A secondary issue that bothers me is the Wikipedia page entitled """"ethnic Macedonians"""" related to FYROM (as if to say that Macedonians are now non-ethnic.) This of course is really offensive to Macedonians but the FYROM page is locked. I think the best approach around this lockout dismissing the human rights of 2.5 million ethnic Macedonians... it to make a new page called ethnic Macedonians (Greek)... which describes the rich history of the Macedonian identity... from ancient Macedon... to Byzantium... to integration with the new Greek state.... to distinct Pan=Macedonian foreign diasporas dating back decades. Many people only know Macedonians from Alexanders time... I think a page showing the long history of Greek speaking people calling themselves Macedonians would make it much clearer to readers why Macedonians are so sensitive to this name issue.

That would do, why don't you go to every store that every chain has and figure the national average price on everything, then ignore the wages that their employees make (to be spent at the other business in town, maybe even funding your job), and draw up an addition to the article determining who benefits from shopping where. Let's say Company X has a store, with 500 jobs, paying $10 an hour, then Company W comes in,  adds 500 jobs, paying $6 an hour, drives Company X under, now the wages that Company W pays are the ones being spent in the area, guess everyone benefits from a 40% drop in the spending from 500 people's incomes. ->"," none"

Orton = Does whatever the fuck he wants because he is a main star and friends with Triple H. Should have been fired already for smoking pot in front of everyone.

"I am always skeptical about these 'naked spacewalks' for various reasons. They say our body is ~70% water, but that does not really paint an accurate picture. The reality is that we are more like soda pop in a bottle, where we have a certain amount of nitrogen, oxygen, and other trace gasses dissolved in our bloodstream at STP. The key here is the STP part. As with a bottle of soda, when the pressure is decreased, the gasses rapidly come out of solution, which is what produces the fizz. Similarly, if your body went rapidly from STP to the vacuum of outer space, you would almost certainly experience a similar effect. To be blunt, your blood would quite literally boil and you would surly die of an aneurysm or internal bleeding from all the vessels which would be breached by the gasses trying to escape. About the closest I've seen to this being accurately portrayed is in the film Event Horizon, where it shows all the vessels on Justin's body becoming visible as they rapidly expand when the airlock pressure is decreased. But still, it does not explain where the gas goes, which is the same problem in this film. It seems wholly impossible to survive such a drastic change in atmospheric pressure. ->"," none"

 How to change the title of a page 

Hi, if a page has the wrong title, you mustn't use cut and paste to change it. The thing to do is to use """"Move"""" - one of the tabs at the top of the page. That way the page history is preserved. It's very simple... unless a page already exists at the name you're trying to move to, in which case it's a bit more complicated! I'll try and undo the page move you did the wrong way, and redo it correctly.  Unfortunately I'll have to get an admin to delete a page on the way - so it won't be instant.   "" ->"," none"

Homosexuality in Ancient Greece

Do homosexuals like you get turned on at the thought that these great ancient people's may have accepted homosexuality? Why do you have to distort history to fit your image? 

first off there is no concrete evidence that alexander liked it up the butt...let's get that straight...no pun intended

second i'm sure there was gay shit back in the day, like in every culture...but i don't believe everyone was doing it....just because you find two pots out of a 1000 that show some gay act...doesn't mean everyone back then was gay

third...there is a difference between brotherly love and being gay or a pedophile...i say i love my friends and in greece i even kiss them on the cheek when i see them..that doesn't mean i want their ass...look at shaq and wade slapping each other's ass in basketball are you telling me they are gay?

fourth...just because some plays back in the day reffered to certain people being gay...doesn't mean they were...alot of plays (especially comedies) were made to be critical or make fun of people by dehumanizing them or making them look stupid...like calling them gay...just look at comedies now making fun of people...someone might say the president today is gay in a comedy skit, but we all know he is straight

fifth...i hate gay propaganda...i know they are people blah blah blah...but to try to impose on a great culture some of their values to justify their way of life is pathetic...just because there are no great gay people in history doesn't mean you have to ripout pieces of history to make your people look good....from alexander to hitler to lincoln...you guys try to change history or make things up to fit your own cause

i leave with quotes from two authors who wrote gay stuff on alexander

Some modern historians point out that the ancient sources cannot be considered definitive. Robin Lane Fox writes: """"Later gossip presumed that Bagoas was Alexanders lover. This is uncertain."""" [16] And, according to Mary Renault, who wrote a novel about the relationship of Alexander and Bagoas, """"No historian states plainly whether they were physical lovers."""" [17]

key words: uncertain, no historian

"I think that it is unlikely that good faith is as much of an issue for most of us as is being unconsciously blind to our own biases. It is clear that Rhwentworth is highly invested in NVC, and while he may have a business COI, I think it is more likely he would simply like to protect NVC from what he sees, given his expertise, as unfair criticism. Sunray is more curious. S/he has, in my opinion, been extremely defensive, tendentious and aggressive, having accused several of us of wikilawyering and harboring a hidden agenda against NVC, as well as claiming we had reached consensus when in fact the defenders (mostly me) had simply given up, having felt bulldozed. S/he has also consistently removed material from the criticisms section, because s/he incorrectly assessed the sources, could not find a convenient link to the source, or because the source was deemed inappropriate for criticismyet left the source in place for material elsewhere in the article. I have no idea why Sunray is so aggressive about critiques of NVC, but I doubt it is a COI or bad faith.

The strong objections to the critiques by a number of pro-NVC advocates, such as Sunray and Rhwentworth, essentially consist of the idea that there are no valid criticisms of NVC. In the previous arguments over these sources, the substance of the objection came down to either rejecting the source as unreliable (for criticism but not for promotion) or claiming that the source misunderstands NVC and thus is simply wrong. So at this point, the only critique of NVC we have noted in the article is that it lacks critique. Given the strong and diverse critiques of NVC that have been published, this is sad to me.

I pointed out that disparaging of the sources of criticism of NVC as being unreliable, minority, inaccurate etc. should also apply to the sources supporting NVC. On this talk page, I went through every reference in the article and showed that they were nearly all from promotional or minority literature. It is hard to find traditionally reliable (e.g. academic, peer-reviewed, mainstream, etc.) sources for any aspect of NVC. This has marginally improved.

I suggested previously that we have a responses section rather than a critique or criticisms section, which I hoped would allow some of the responses from non-academic or non-traditional sources to be aired in the article. We have been stuck arguing about the academic sources, however, so I am thinking that the less reliable sources would not be accepted. 

I believe that beyond the argument we are having about sources for explicit criticism of NVC, there are other big issues. The article was originally criticized by editors as sounding promotional, and we made some headway in fixing this. Lately, however, the article has again been rewritten, in my opinion, to promote NVC. This consists of burying information that might cast NVC in a less than glorious light and by making the article essentially a description of how the advocates of NVC see it as working, rather than putting it into a context for naive readers. For example, Sunray argued very strongly that NVC is not a conflict resolution technique, but is a trademark of an organization and therefore should not be criticized under the BLP policy. I then added the information that NVC is trademarked to the intro, but this was removed to the very end of the article. (Perhaps there should be an 'sm' next to each mention of NVC, since it is a trademarked item.) The one study of NVC efficacy described in detail in the article as research was published in a non-peer-reviewed newsletter. This information was removed to the reference section rather than staying in the article itself, where I put it. The fact that there is nearly no discussion, research or confirmation of NVC in the literature was removed from the introduction to become the sole critique of NVC, at the end of the article. And, as one of the sources on NVC notes, one critique of NVC is that it is based on beliefs rather than research. This is no longer mentioned in the article explicitly. 

As far as moving forward, I think the Gorsevski and the Flack sources are high quality and the reasons adduced for exclusion do not seem sufficient. I do not think we have to go into any detail on the contents of their critiques, but we should mention they exist and provide a citation. I also think that one major critique of NVC is that many organization have attempted to adopt it and found it problematic. This is the opinion of one of our high quality academic (and pro-NVC) sources. I think a sentence to this effect should be included, with the reference. I also think it would be legitimate to include here the opencouchsurfing.com and noesis.org mention, and Sarles self-published critique (which is discussed in the academic source). The pro-NVC academic sources are not afraid to address the critiques, so I am not sure why t ->"," none"

Actually, to my knowledge one of the core teachings of the Vedas is that one has to experience higher states of understanding.  They can not be taught (though a teacher comes in handy at many points in the process to guide one away from misunderstandings).  In the Hindu worldview, of course, it might takes many lifetimes before one is at a stage capable of experiencing the higher states, but still...  the fact that you may spend your whole life devoted to a given teacher is not a goal in itself, but merely a step towards the eventual experience.

". The obvious mistake in the inadequate use of “prosecute” in the translation of the French Rabbinate can be analysed as an unconscious confession and denunciation of the falsification committed by the rabbinical ancestors.

TABFor when he dictates his Commandments, the Eternal does not play with double meanings. Then here on the Sinai, the historical context is that of abandonment of circumcision until Gilgal. Therefore, only the bad faith of the fanatic victims of circumcision could twist the text in a misinterpretation that nobody should ever have imagined. For in order to restore circumcision, the rabbis were compelled to conceal the veritable meaning of the Second Com-mandment through falsifying the sense of the most sacred text of the Torah since directly written by God. The manipulation of the faithful is obvious. The sole attenuating circumstance would be pathological denial of the reality of the meaning of the Second Commandment, due to blind faith in Abraham’s commandment and to the deep psychological trauma its implementation provokes. It is indeed high time to put an end to it.

TABBesides, it is possible to word a hypothesis about the two versions of the Second Commandment, that which forbids circumcision and that which does not mention it. Until today, the authenticity of the Book of Deuteronomy has been considered warranted by the fact that the manuscript was found again buried in the temple of Jerusalem at the return from the exile in Babylon. But it is impossible that God should have varied in his formulation of the Ten Commandments; the Levite rabbis varied, not God. The redaction of the book of Deuteronomy has certainly been altered, truncated from the ban of circumcision. One must think that the discovery in the temple was a whole performance intended to warrant the return to circumcision. For the rabbis only knew the book of Deuteronomy, a book of rules of boring reading whilst the book of the Exodus was well-known to the people; it was the source of religious education and it was impossible to falsify it, only its interpretation could be changed. The version of the Book of the Exodus is both the authentic version and the one written at the intention of Nebuchadnezzar. Indeed, at the time of captivity, those who obeyed the divine will to respect the human body were likely still numerous. The Jews were divided about this point and the version of the Exodus enabled the rabbis to explain the fact to Nebuchadnezzar, while distinguishing the Jews from the Egyptians in order to avoid slaughter. The version of the Book of Deuteronomy was made up at the return from exile in order to warrant the new orthodox interpretation of the Second commandment of the Book of the Exodus.

TABAbolishing the commandment of Abraham, the Second Commandment makes the right to physical integrity the first of the rights of man. One can even think that in the Third Commandment that comes right after this condemnation of circumcision:

“You will not invoke the name of the Eternal your God to support lie...” (20: 7, French Rabbinate),

Moses reproaches Abraham for having perjured saying that God would have ascribed him circumcision. A shrewd reader of the Bible, Mohammed took up this accusation in verses 4: 118-119 of the Koran (see below). For if God ever ordered Abraham circumcision, he forbade Moses to do it. Either it was not the same God or he changed his mind between both Alliances, or still Abraham lied and no God ever ordered circumcision. The Book of the Deuteronomy confirms that God did not impose circumcision to Moses ->"," none"

Espionage or a dick spying on some pussy lovers involves an individual obtaining information that is considered secret or confidential without the permission of the holder of the information. Espionage is inherently clandestine, as the legitimate holder of the information may change plans or take other countermeasures once it is known that the information is in unauthorized hands. See clandestine HUMINT for the basic concepts of such information collection, and subordinate articles such as clandestine HUMINT operational techniques and clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting for discussions of the """"tradecraft"""" used to collect this information.
Hey I gotta joke and it goes like this:Dick says """"Hey Balls get ready for a patry"""" Balls replies """"You fucking liar. Everytime we go to a party, you always go in and leave us out here knockin.  

History
Incidents of espionage are well documented throughout history. The ancient writings of Chinese and Indian military strategists such as Sun-Tzu and Chanakya contain information on deception and subversion. Chanakya's student Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire, made use of assassinations, spies and secret agents, which are described in Chanakya's Arthasastra. The ancient Egyptians had a thoroughly developed system for the acquisition of intelligence, and the Hebrews used spies as well, as in the story of Rahab. Feudal Japan often used ninja to gather intelligence. More recently, spies played a significant part in Elizabethan England (see Francis Walsingham). Many modern espionage methods were well established even then. http://www.henrywotton.org.uk/

The Cold War involved intense espionage activity between the United States of America and its allies and the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and their allies, particularly related to nuclear weapons secrets. Recently, espionage agencies have targeted the illegal drug trade and those considered to be terrorists.

Different intelligence services value certain  intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred  human sources over  research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. Both Soviet political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU
 ) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited. 

Various Forms
Unlike other forms of  intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored, or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people to whom he was selling information.

The US defines espionage towards itself as """"The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defense with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. Espionage is a violation of 18 United States Code 792-798 and Article 106, Uniform Code of Military Justice{{cite web

I do not know how far you up to date with the conflict that is keeping editors from editing the page. If not, I suggest you have a look at the arbitration case that is currently pending.  

To facilitate, this was the version most people (except Marcosantezana) could live with:

Natural selection is the process in which individual organisms that possess favourable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce.  Natural selection works on the phenotype, the outward form determined by genes (the genotype), the environment and the interaction between them. Only heritable variations in a trait will be passed on to the next generation and the frequency of favourable heritable traits will increase in subsequent generations. The underlying genetic variation in traits is the result of genetic processes, such as mutations and recombinations, and can undo the effect of natural selection if strong enough relative to the effect of natural selection. Natural selection, together with other mechanisms such as genetic drift and mutations, is an important component of evolution, a cornerstone of modern biological and medical research.

The term was introduced by Charles Darwin in 1859 in his book """"The Origin of Species"""", as an analogy with a farmer choosing individuals that possess desired characteristics for his breeding stock, which Darwin called artificial selection.

Maybe you find it not god, and in that case, I am curious what you think of that.

One of the issues that keeps getting brought up is the lack of evidence on the First Vision. It's been said repeatedly that there's """"no historical evidence"""" that Smith had this vision and that it wasn't historically significant enough to be discussed in the context of his early life. Let me counter this with a short quote from the Preface to Robert Remini's biography on Joseph Smith:
""""I should make it clear at the outset that I am not a Mormon. As such I faced several problems in writing this book, one of which involved Joseph's visions and revelations, which are crucial to an understanding of him, his Church, and the times in which he lived. After considerable thought I decided to present his religious experiences just as he described them in his writings and let readers decide for themselves to what extent they would give credence to them. I am not out to prove or disprove any of his claims. As a historian I have tried to be as objective as possible in narrating his life and work."""" (Remini p. x)
In his book, Remini presents the First Vision as Smith said it happened, the same as other biographers do, and the same way I believe we should do. Like Remini, we should not be trying to prove or disprove any of Smith's claims, but unlike Remini, or job is fairly simple. We don't have to worry about what was historical and what was not. We don't need to do original research. Our job is to reflect reliable sources. ~

 Ubique 

I have undone your edit to K Battery Royal Artillery where your edit summary was Unlinked: Ubique; no evidence for notability for this honour.  Just to clarify, Ubique is the only Battle Honour of the Royal Artillery, Royal Horse Artillery and the Royal Engineers.

The Royal Artillery was present in nearly all battles and would have earned most of the honours awarded to cavalry and infantry regiments. In 1833, William IV awarded the motto Ubique (meaning """"everywhere"""") in place of all battle honours.    "" ->"," none"

 A request... 

Just completed the latest lesson for the VC.  Would you proofread/edit it please?

BTW, I've looked over your contributions again.  Your participation in deletion debates is good.

The main objection in your RfA was """"Lack of policy experience"""".  The basic reasoning is, that it is impossible for avid editors to read pages without editing them, so if you've read the policies and guidelines, that would show up in your contributions.  On guidelines you can generally make minor changes directly to the guidelines themselves.  With policies, unless it is fixing grammar or typos, you pretty much need to post the edits you want to make to the talk page for approval - but that becomes habit after you get used to it.  So my advice is that you start proofreading the P&G;'s, and see where that takes you.  I see David Fuchs has prepared a nomination for you.  Before you accept another nom, you should probably get in around 1000 meaningful edits to policy and guidelines pages and their respective talk pages, and about 500 edits in dispute resolution RFCs, s, some mediation, etc.  Then ask '''''"" ->"," none"

 Pretty badly written introduction. 

Namely that the writer seems more interested in writing about common law than civil law. While I am sure some degree of comparison is very useful, if not necessary, I don't think that going to great lengts to explain what common law is and then just say """"and civil law is not like this"""" is a very good way of defining civil law.

The 4th paragraph in the intro (the largest one) is the main culprit here. In fact the third sentence in it doesn't even follow on properly from the first two and should logically read pretty much the opposite of what it does. In addition it seems to be be very US-centric: while it mentions English Common Law, it then goes on to list examples of basic tenets of this which seem to be drawn directly from the US Constitution.

So I think it's pretty badly written as an introduction, but as I don't know too much about the subject I don't really want to go about editing it myself."" ->"," none"

"Kathleen Andrews Submission 

Hi Ritchie333, 

I would like to thank you for helping me submit Kathleen Andrews legacy to Wikipedia. Wow!!!!! You Made my day as I've been trying for a very long time!! THANK YOU!!!

Im very new to Wikipedia, so I am not sure how to do this but in Kathleen Andrews story, it listed her as First Female Dispatcher, and thats true, but she was also the First Female ETS Bus Operator, First Female Dispatcher and First Female in ETS Management. The emphasis on the First female Bus Operator should be first, if that's possible.

I look forward to hearing from you and a BIG THANK YOU for all of your help!!!

Take care

"Um, can anyone verify Mary Elizabeth Sheridan?
She's listed on IMDb and recently had her 121st birthday but she's nowhere to be seen on this wikipedia page. Can anyone do some research or verification?
Link   —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  
 Before any such process is started, you should first confirm this person is actually still alive. I strongly doubt that, but in the case she is, it would of course be worth trying to validate her. However, if the birthdate is correct in IMDB, she had her 111th birthday, not 121st.(  )

Oldest people in the world graph
I see that Jughead has added a pretty nifty graph which represents all known oldest people at a given time from 1830 to the present date. But I can see a few problems right off the top - for one, the chart should start from 1955 which is really where the record starts in any substantive manner, as that is when the record started to be kept and subsequently amended back to. While we may be able to compile a list of oldest people going back into the 19th century, besides the fact that patchy birth records make such a compilation somewhat meaningless, any compilation beyond what already exists on this page would be original research. 

Secondly, it is hard to really understand what the graph represents, with a lot of tiny dots. Close clusters of dots really represent  the fact that record-holders held the title briefly, a low cluster means someone held the record for a long time. Which was only really true after 1955. The chart implies that Betsy Baker who is represented by the dot circa 1955 held the record for a whopping 25 years, which is obviously not so. And thirdly, the current record-holder just turned 115, yet is shown as being 116.

My suggestion would be to keep the vertical axis as is, but to create a bar graph for individual years of BIRTH starting with the first record-holder Betsy Baker's birth year, 1842, draw a bar for the maximum age attained for any person born in that year and do the same for each year up to 1892, the most recent birth year for which no people are proven still alive. And this would not be original research, as there is a page with this list: . There is someone for each year save 1845 there.   
Hello. Thanks for pointing out those mistakes, Jack. I'll try to improve the graph soon. Fell free to offer any more suggestions. ->"," none"

Carried over from AN

For some reason the discussion was """"archived"""".

In no way am I asserting that you are related to Pol64, although from the backlog of checkuser requests it is as clear to me as it is to anyone else that a lot of suspicions have been raised, based on may I say particularly intriguing patterns. For example, your last session stopped and began directly before and after Pol64's, repeating a pattern that was identified in one of those earlier checkuser requests. I will not be drawn here, but IMO, you have something to prove.

As for your implication about myself, I'll assume that was just heat (as it was when I was accused of being you!). I suppose everybody gets accused at some time by you (inspired, it seems by any form if disagreement). But despite the obvious flimsiness, maybe it would be a good idea to retract that comment.  

I have nothing to prove whatsoever re Pol, nor am I responsible for when he edits though I would point out I edit a lot. I don't think I need to retract any comments but will say that any new accounts appearing on the PAW articles are bound to raise suspicion, this air of paranoia I blame entirely on those blocked users who have chosen to return as socks. There is no question that both DPetersen and Pol64 have also used socks, so this isn't exclusive to the PPA editors. If you are a genuine editor please accept my apologies for wondering if you are a sock and hope, from the above, that you understand why. Thanks,  "" ->"," none"

"| reason= I think another admin needs to look at this case, firstly the user GoodDay has sexually offensive comments on his talk page, i asked him about it and he then quickly deleted them to try and cover his tracks, but they still are on his log, after this out of anger hes been stalking me and pasting my IP address all over wikipedia and hes done this for well over 2 weeks now, sorry but this isn't normal behaviour, this guy has an obsession my brother then with me, i then called him a pervert becuase he clearly is one, and i get banned? Other users have also left comments on his userpage telling him to stop stalking them and stirring up trouble. One of the main reasons i had to quit wikipedia was becuase the user GoodDay kept stalking my userpage and my edits, pasting around my IP address and causing trouble for me and keep talking about my brother, i don't know if this user is racist but my brother has had a problem with him, i feel unsafe on here also. If you checked my contributions for wikipedia over the last 2 years you would realise i have added far more than any of those users on the ANI board, i have no idea why i got banned for calling GoodDay for what he truly is, if you check the chatlogs you would see he has spouted out many abusive insults, i do not insult people i just call it as it is, i accept a 2 week ban then but please tell GoodDay to stop stalking my userpage, leaving me messages and pasting around my Ip address and spreading lies about my brother he seems to have an obession with, this is clearly all against wiki policy and abuse. also note i am most likely getting the local authorities in on this issue 86.10.119.131 ->"," none"

"Firstly where did you all get the idea that Association football is the correct official name for the sport .It might be the official name for that sport in America just like how in the rest of the world , the official name for the kind of football played in America is American football .

But obviously  rest of the world is a bigger domain than America - so the general consensus should be what most people in the world feel .

Secondly people do refer to football as soccer in UK - no one is denying that .But if people say that they are going to watch a football match , it obviously means a soccer match - not a rugby match .

Just because a very small minority in the world feels football refers to some other sport- why should we insult the beautiful game by not devoting the page on football to football as the world knows it?

Majority of the world refers to Osama Bin Laden as a terrorist .But there are still many people in the world who refers to Osama as a freedom fighter .So does that mean we say Osama Bin Laden is a freedom fighter? No.

When you have 6 billion people in the world and more than 5 billion refer to football as the FIFA version which is a very very large majority (the fact that FIFa has more members than the UN and the fact that FIFA has the word football in it should justify that fact) , then shouldnt the general consensus swerve towards the majority .

"""Carl_Paladino&diff;=388097440&oldid;=388080941 October 1], and again on October 2. On Linda McMahon, you have a long history of editing and edit warring on the page, and probably would have been blocked if Malinaccier hadn't protected the page on September 17; your October 1 and October 2 edits are inadvisable due to your history on that page, but I'm not really concerned with those since the things you reverted are borderline vandalism. Therefore the main motivation for the current block was your final edit to Carl Paladino.    ♦ ♣ ♠ 
I'm not sure I buy two reverts in two days as disruptive edit warring. Moreover, the combination of low speed and non-explicit warnings are concerning. Certainly, the articles in question attract people writing for differing political agendas, but I'm not aware of any specific sanctions/enforcement which apply to these articles at the moment.   
Sir - my """"history of edit warring"""" was basically two years ago.  20 total edits on a page [Linda McMahon]] which another editor has over 800 edits does not seem to me to show anything near an edit war.  So I am surprised to see your rationale is the Carl Paladino page!   is a legitimate edit, and not actionable at all.  is also proper, and a day earlier.  I have a grand total of 28 edits on that page, or an average or just over an edit a day also removing clear vandalism as well).  But you blocked me without any indication of my crime, and were absent for quite a while - leaving me in limbo.  Frankly, 72 hours for a person who has no recent edit war problems seems extreme.   And for this use of block as punishment - I have doubts as to propriety thereof.  Did you block because Ohiostandard kept asserting that I was edit warring?  AFAICT, he never even posted a single diff for his charge. Thank you - now can I be unblocked so I can resume normal editing?  My radiation treatment limits my activities quite a bit.  Oh - look at this sort of """"editor"""" I have had to face at ,  and a favorite example to show the kind of edits I reverted on the article.

WRT asserting that Ohiostandard 'warned me"""" - he never edited on the Paladino article, nor mentioned it to me. Right now the block is clearly punitive, and I respectfully request it be removed with a note that it was not """"edit war"""" on my part. I do not see the point in having a clear record for nearly two years - and then being blocked for a 1RR because someone """"thinks"""" I must be watched! The only connection I have with Ohiostandard is that he did not like my post about Screwball23.   
Examples of current edits from others  .  And of course the current content of """" Content of the emails in question includes video of dancing African tribesmen under the title """"Obama Inauguration Rehearsal"""", a video titled """"Miss France 2008 Fucking"""", an altered image of President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama dressed as a pimp and a prostitute, an image of a cargo plane landing in an African desert behind a group of panicked men titled """"Run, Niggers, Run!"""" and a video portraying a woman engaged in copulation with a horse.  For some odd reason, I had thought this was actually improper on WP.  I take it that I was wrong if reverting such edits is """"edit war.""""

Heqwm, continuing to make edits against consensus is unhelpful.
Consensus?  What planet are you on?  There have been only two other editors commenting, and one seems to agree that other sources are required, and the other agrees that """"Wikipedia can't accept an editors own personal interpretation of the Bible"""".

I will not further address your points on civility. We're here to discuss issues, not people. At the same time, calling my responses """"ridiculous"""" sours the debate.
Ah, so you won't discuss civility... except to criticize me.  Posting ridiculous arguments is what sours the debate.  I can't have a discussion with you if you insist on making up new definitions for words, such as """"plain reading"""" meaning """"whatever I say it means"""" and """"opinion"""" meaning """"anything people disagree on"""".

I have not labeled your views in such a way and am carefully avoiding this.
So declaring your interpretation """"plain meaning"""" is not in any way conceited and a clear declaration that my position is without any merit?

I have """"cited the Bible like it directly says"""".
Did you even read what I wrote?  Your editing of my words indicate that you didn't even bother trying to understand what I'm saying.

I have explained why even on plain reading one is not forced to accept that """"ten commandments"""" there must refer to the ritual decalogue,

 Identity of the designer 

The paragraph just above the heading """"Origins of the term"""" states:

""""Intelligent design deliberately does not try to identify or name the specific agent of creation — it merely states that one (or more) must exist. Although intelligent design itself does not name the designer, the personal view of many proponents is that the designer is the Christian god.[34][22][35] Whether this was a genuine feature of the concept or just a posture taken to avoid alienating those who would separate religion from the teaching of science has been a matter of great debate between supporters and critics of intelligent design. The Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District court ruling held the latter to be the case.""""

The above statement contains a popular misconception about the identity of the designer. ID leaders have indeed named the designer. 

The article's reference #34 above is to Dembski's 1999 Touchstone article in which he says that """"intelligent design is just the Logos theology of John's Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory."""" When Dembski said that, he was identifying, indeed defining, the designer as not only God but Jesus Christ, to which """"Logos"""" refers in the Gospel of John, as Barbara Forrest points out on pp. 3-4 of her paper http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/intelligent-design.pdf.

See also the article's reference #142 at pp. 39-40 of """"Is It Science Yet? Intelligent Design Creationism and the Constitution,"""" at  http://law.wustl.edu/WULQ/83-1/p%201%20Brauer%20Forrest%20Gey%20book%20pages.pdf.  Note here also that Phillip Johnson also defines ID as requiring God when he defines it as """"theistic realism.""""

So it is clear that it is more than """"a personal view of many proponents"""" that the designer is the Christian God.   "" ->"," none"

It is a misinterpretation in many cases of what is originally a communism-capitalism problem to be stated as a communism-religious group contradiction. If a religious group (an Jews, Catholics, Muslims,... serve the same as examples) stand in anticommunists stances then, of course, they will get reaction from the communists.

 Operation Northwords 
Listing Operation Northwoods as a conspiracy theory is bias and unfounded by the very definition of Conspiracy Theory that this article gives. If a conspiracy theory is a theory involving a """"coordinated group"""" which """"is, or was, secretly working to commit illegal or wrongful actions, including attempting to hide the existence of the group and its activities"""" then Operation Northwoods does not fit the criteria. First of all, the CIA does not try to keep its self hidden or secret. It is a known agency and the plans of Operation Northwoods are no more a Conspiracy Theory just because they where kept secret then any of its other actions that the CIA plans or performs on a daily basses that are all kept secret from the general public. Secondly, Operation Northwoods was not a conspiracy within the CIA either. Not one CIA member kept it a secret from anyone who should have known about it. It other words the protocols and the chain of command for this plan was followed precisely as they should have been. And because of that fact, it was shot down, the architect of the plan was fired, the plan never took action and it was well documented which is why we know of the plan under the Freedom of Information Act. This is the exact opposite of a conspiracy theory.   

 Conspiracism 

The section conspiracism says:

'Conspiracy theories are often not taken seriously, because so many conspiracy theories - almost by definition - lack readily verifiable evidence. 

This phrase is unnecessary to introduce conspiracism and is full of weasel words: """"often taken not seriously"""" (has anybody made a statistic?) """"many conspiracy theories lack verifiable evidence"""" (how many?) and it happens """"almost by  definition""""(??) what in the definition states tht the theory has to lack evidence???  

If nobody has nothing to comment about that I will delete the sentence above.  

I disagree with the above sentence - and for sure it is not neutral but  guess that it meant that the conspiracy groups hides the evidents and/or create them (vide the 9/11 passport [I don't want to argue was it fabricated - I mentioning that accorsing to some people it was fabricated]).   

 Sequence of sections and bias 

The way this article is set up suggests a very, very strong POV and it is not even really attempting to be neutral. First problem is the examples, for one they shouldn't be the second thing since it's mainly a partial list. This should be towards the end of the article. Also there is the descriptions:

The John F. Kennedy assassination was a plot by people in high places and not the work of lone gunman Lee Harvey Oswald. Oliver Stone's film JFK is based on this premise.

While this is a conspiracy theory, one I think is somewhat likely, it is actually the most extreme of conspiracy theories in this regard. Other theories were that this was a mob hit or carried out by Cuba or the Soviets. The UFO conspiracy theory is also stated in the more extreme manner. Some theories are that the U.S. government conceals an alien presence because they're afraid of it causing a scare, which sounds more reasonable than, """"to be used for war and other ideas, mainly towards the New World order.""""

Also the fourth section is almost completely dedicated to explaining conspiracy theories in a discrediting manner, treating them like psychological abnormalities or attempts by confused individuals to make sense of a nonsensical world. It seems to be the most common and most annoying criticism of conspiracy theories. This section also is half of the actual article, with the rest mainly being an explanation of the terminology and even mentions of fictional conspiracies. Very little of this article goes to treating conspiracy theories as a justifiable practice in critical thinking that like all legitimate studies can lead to rather ridiculous theories. For instance, there are legitimate questions about 9-11, such as the $100,000 given to Atta by a head of the ISI. There are also allegations that the 9-11 Commission due to its structure and the associations of its head with the Administration was unable to do a thorough and independent investigation, with it ultimately being little more than a coverup. In every case critical thinking demands some form of explanation or theory for such facts. For instance one is that the Administration is trying to cover up connections between Pakistan and/or Saudi Arabia and 9-11. This w ->"," none"

 Episode naming 

Hi, Cyberia.  There's actually been a lot of discussion about this subject at Wikipedia:Naming conventions (television) and its talk page.  The consensus of most of the editors there is that articles should be disambiguated only when it's necessary — that is, when there's no other article by that name.  This is why, for example, Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down was moved to that location from Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down (Battlestar Galactica) — there is no other article that could be at that page.  This is in keeping with the general disambiguation guidelines at WP:D, specifically WP:D#Deciding to disambiguate, which says:
Ask yourself: When a reader enters this term and pushes """"Go"""", what article would they most likely be expecting to view as a result? (For example, when someone looks up Joker, would they find information on a comedian? On a card? On Batman's nemesis? On the hit song or album by The Steve Miller Band?) When there is no risk of confusion, do not disambiguate nor add a link to a disambiguation page.
The argument you give (that using parenthetical phrases consistently keeps articles consistent and makes them easier to identify) has been considered in the debate at WT:TV-NC, but most editors felt that the """"consistency"""" was a misleading virtue, since preemptive disambiguation actually makes articles less consistent with the general Wikipedia naming scheme.  And the article itself should provide enough context to identify it.  The category system also unites articles on a similar topic.

The Star Trek precedent is, in my opinion, a bad one; the editors at the Star Trek WikiProject have been informed of the discussion at WT:TV-NC, and it is likely that Star Trek episode articles will also be moved soon.

I admit that Resurrection Ship and Cylon resurrection ship are a slightly complicated case, but I think that since the episode is titled Resurrection Ship (with a capital """"S"""") and the ship itself is at Cylon resurrection ship (with no capitals), it's sufficiently clear.  However, if you and other BSG editors feel that it's better to have Resurrection ship as a disambiguation page, with the episode at Resurrection Ship (Battlestar Galactica episode) and the ship at Cylon resurrection ship, that would be OK too. — (talk • contribs) 

It's been considered.  See the extensive discussion at WT:TV-NC and its archives, especially here. Basically, the argument is that disambiguation isn't about identifying a subject unless there are two articles that might otherwise share the same name.  So it's appropriate for """"The Enemy Within"""" to be disambiguated The Enemy Within (TOS episode), since there are other meanings of The Enemy Within (disambiguation).  But there's no need for Charlie X to be disambiguated, since only the TOS episode has that name. — (talk • contribs)

 please put this on ANI for me. 

1. Civility - I made one comment on a users talk page in a semi-sandbox section that they made regarding dog meat, that I thought it was inhumane and that some of the edits are based on nationalistic motives. Yes this was a personal comment, but it was certainly not racist nor directed at anyone in particular. If you blocked every who ever made a comment conveying their personal opinion on a users talk page, wikipedia would have about 3 editors left.

Also I posted """"LOL that made me laugh"""" on another users page, I really don't see any problem with that.

2. Harassment/Stalking - as I outlined in my unblock request, I have checked the edits of other editors and reverted when I saw the need. These are not random editors, these are editors who have brought themselves to my attention with their patterns of what I consider to be flawed edits. This is how wikipedia works, you make a dodgy edit, people revert you, check your edit history and see what other dodgy edits you have made, taking action when needed.

In short, I see no reason whatsoever for me deserving a one week block for a personal comment, a LOL and checking the edits of users who got my attention by their editing patterns.

Ditto on GAN. To me, the article is ready, though I still intend to make some minor edits. On another front, I think we ought to leave the dating issue where it stands, even though I disagree with Heylin's assessment of mid-July, which he guesses at based on the fact that BoB made its debut on the charts on July 30 (see Shades, p. 264). I find that ridiculous. For example, BIABH took six weeks from its official release on March 7, 1965, to reach the charts (May 8). Highway 61 got out much quicker, with a one-month lapse from its August 20 release before charting. Going back earlier, Another Side took about six weeks to chart and Freewheelin', more about than three months,  Using mid-July, then, means giving BoB  two weeks to debut, which is absurd. Of course, the whole problem centers on what is meant by """"release."""" In this case, it's being used to mean distribution, which was obviously delayed in BoB's case. However, the Billboard advertisement of June 25 gives at least three other clues to that: pressing, packaging and promotion. With those three in place, distribution couldn't have been more than a week behind if not already in motion.   "" ->"," none"

"Amandajm: Ignorant Muslim & Disgusting Anti-white Racist
Reading back on racist, Amandajm - I've come to realize that in addition to his muslim name, he veritably hates white people. He deletes info about european history even if such info is based upon accurate inferences. Why he does this should be the subject of debate. My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim. Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european. Honestly, he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all. 'Stay on your side of the fence', is a motto I always quote.

To that, yesterday I followed up by sending emails to Homeland Security and the FBI Counter-terrorism Division for investigation into who he is and what his motives are. (No, I've not gone off the deep end). I received an automatic response email from the FBI stating that they will look into the matter, and will definitley be following up. Racist muslims of this type are tricky and can pose a risk to the US. Also, I sent an email to wiki complaining about this enemy of europeans and americans. I got an email back from wiki stating that he will be reviewed - thank god! His place in wiki - and in the US - shouldn't be secure. ->"," toxic"

Your recent edit at Sarahs talk page 
You recently made a comment on Sarah777's talkpage which was quite strong in content. If this comment was not being addressed to Sarah, but to the IP contributor who preceeded you on the page, then it should have been made on the IP's talkpage. You should only address Sarah on Sarah's page. If, OTOH, you were addressing your remarks to sarah then you were way out of line. Either way I think you owe Sarah an apology. I also thing you should revert your edit and place it on the IPs talk page.   

It is quite obvious that i'm addressing it to the IP as Sarah never made a threat. It is hardly way out of line seeing as the IP was making what could be easily regarded as combative threat. Also its a talk page, but if you insist i shall remove the message to their talk page. An apology? I remember the last time i asked you for an apology.  (talk) 

I'm actually thinking of reverting my removal of the message as the IP's address is not static and each time they appear, their IP will be different.  (talk) 
The IPs threat is as hollow as his/her head. I wouldn't pay much attention to it.   
No need to personally attack them with the hollow comment. A threat by an Irishman (republican or loyalist) should never be taken as hollow lol.  (talk) 

I never made a threat , mabuska , so stop crying . GoodDay , my head is far from hollow, I have a static IP ,so how do I do it? please explain and personal remarks are not allowed please apologise .Back to mabuska. Never met a loyalist who is Irish , not once , did you ? """"could be easily regarded as combative threat."""" If I did make a threat you would have no problems reading it , even as like myself english is not your first tongue .

This is going to be fun .  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 109.78.243.56   

If you want to be a disruptive, arguementative, combative editor, go ahead. Such editors usually end up being indefinately blocked. Actually the vast majority of broadband IP's are never static as far as i'm as i'm aware, so unless you create an actual account to edit with, you will end up with a different IP every different day or week you appear unless it cycles back to one you've already used.

Anyways who said i was a loyalist? Never said i was and will state quite clearly for you that i am not one. If i was i'd had no shame in declaring that i am.

You show your own lack of knowledge of Irish history anyways. What was James Craig, someone you can call a loyalist, described as at his funeral? As a proud Ulsterman and Irishman. Edward Carson himself was a proud Irishman but can also be easily classified as a loyalist. They always said the Troubles was mostly due to ignorance and prejudice - especially towards history. 

If you really want to make a difference on Wikipedia and be somewhat successful at doing so the best way is to play by Wikipedias rules and not by being disruptive or coming out with childish remarks such as """"stop crying"""" or implying threats.  (talk) 

Never called you a loyalist -where did you get that from I dont makes assumptions , asked you a question , you failed to answer - the men you mention are no longer and by definition you could not meet them Ireland is a sovereign state and that was my point even the loyalist I know are not Irish citizens which is what Irish is defined as , never implied a threat stop crying lol , Wikipedia has to obey wider rules than its own , I have no lack of knowledge , how do editors get block by not going by the rules -I havent broken any nor will I , now if you dont mind I have some work to do , now apologise to me for FALSELY saying I threatened you ."" ->"," none"

Due to the nature of the Zachary Stone AfD, I relisted. If there hadn't been the concern from the subject, I would have closed it as keep. The other three that you closed I relisted because both the arguments for keeping or deleting the articles was weak. I felt that they needed wider input before closing one way or another.

 2010 team roster 

Moved from User talk:Kevin McE

Hi there. I wonder if you might be able to clarify your reason for making this edit where you cited WP:CRYSTAL. I'm not clear on why the information you removed is inappropriate. Thanks.   

I don't know what needs to be explained.  We cannot say with certainty that those riders will ride for that team next year, because we do not know the future.  An encyclopaedia reports facts, not expectations.    

Hi again. Firstly, I moved your comment back here to keep this in one place so it is easier to follow. I am still not clear exactly what at WP:CRYSTAL makes this content inappropriate. This is not a predicted team roster, it is verifiable and very likely to be accurate since the chance of Team Sky confirming they have signed a contract with a rider for 2010 and then that not happening must be very slim.   

It is verifiable that these men have signed to ride for that team next year, that is in the preceding paragraph and I would not challenge the appropriateness of stating that.  A 2010 roster (not a word that should be used on an article about a UK subject, but that is a different matter) is not something that exists in 2009, and even as a speculative list, it is so incomplete as to be meaningless; it also does not use the cycling squad template which is standard for team articles, but these are not the point.  Returning to the Crystal balling issue, you say yourself that the chance of them not riding is very slim: you thus acknowledge that this is a possibility, and therefore their inclusion in the squad is not a definite fact.  Let's hope it doesn't happen, but Sky might go bust, or any one of the signed riders might have a career ending injury, before 1 January, in which case 2010 will arrive, they will not be part of the team, and the encyclopaedia will be guilty of having recorded an error.  Facts, not expectation.    

I will happily accept that the signing of a contract to ride for the team in 2010 doesn't mean that any of these will actually ride for the team in 2010 and that the team might not even exist. However, all these riders have been signed up to ride for the team in 2010, that makes them part of the squad for 2010. We're not simply expecting them to be, they are confirmed to be. Surely though, we would be speculating if we were to disregard that and suggest it might not happen. I think you are misinterpreting WP:CRYSTAL. I'd suggest that it makes it clear that it is perfectly acceptable to include details of future events providing the information is verifiable, as is the case here. If it turns out that any or all of these riders don't ride for Team Sky in 2010 then the Wikipedia article won't have been """"guilty of having recorded an error"""" because it was an entirely accurate description of the situation at this time based upon the information available.   

I'm not saying that it won't happen, nor that it is not very likely, but that it is expectation, not fact.  You speak of verifiability, but life teaches us that the future is not verifiable.  If they were to die before the end of this year, they will not be in the 2010 team: the future is not confirmed.  An """"entirely accurate description"""" of something that does not currently exist is not possible (and as a description, a 6 man top level racing squad is not entirely accurate).   

I find your position on this matter a little strange. You seem to want to defend the article from speculation but in doing so, seem to be introducing your own speculation that the team might not exist or the riders might change. The names that are being announced are for the 2010 squad, so it seems perfectly appropriate to describe the list as such. We can, and should, only base the article on what can be verified at the current time, and that is that the riders named are part of the team for 2010. The information we have at the current time says these individuals are confirmed to ride for the team in 2010 and our article is, and should, only ever be based upon information available at the time. I would note that, not only has another user reverted the change you made which I am concerned about here, but also that a further ten names have been announced ->"," none"

I haven't been around the page much lately (sick of haggling over trivialities), but the last time I checked the lead was largely the one written my Mathsci (which I had tweaked a bit after the mediation was over).  As for my redactions, they were surgical, (carefully removing personal comments without affecting the meaning of the sentence), and mostly affected TechnoFaye (whose mouth consistently runneth over).  I redacted Mathsci's comments 3 or 4 times, as well as comments from several others - it had no impact on the discussion except to remove inflammatory wording.

a side note on the high art of casting the ordinary trivial, into something special
This does not mean that what Risteski wrote on the guitar is not of value. Of course there may be interesting things there. Same with other methods, etc. But this whole topic (guitar pedagogy) seems to be one, where I can get information from anyone, even my neighbor. In other words: The body of knowledge related to guitar pedagogy is, to a great extent, not specialist knowledge with easy categorization of the sources of various ideas. Hence I detest when Risteski writes """"this work will introduce a new guitar teaching philosophy on the virtue of musical-aesthetical knowledge of classical guitar music"""". What he wishes to display as something """"new"""", is rather something that I could easily learn and find, while having discussions with my friends, with a glass of wine. So 'cheers' to guitar philosophy!  

At the same time, I can look at the article and see it empty. Risteski's articles can at least provide some food for thought; and that would be a reason to include them in the external links. I suggest: let's mix a cocktail of philosophical guitar pedagogical content. Add sugar to taste!   
writing articles for wikipedia is different than writing a """"term paper"""" for school or a commentary for a newspaper or a book that you wish to have published. In all of those occaisions you as a writer are supposed to look at primary sources and material published by others, analyse them and put them togehter in ways that support your original thesis. Taking that approach to Wikipedia articles is not acceptable as it violates our no original research policy. For Wikipedia articles writers must take material and analysis that has already been published by others and create and article that reflects all current thought on the topic, giving appropriate propotion to each. 
And again, tagging an external link that does not meet our guidelines for external links onto the end of an article that is not in good shape is NOT an improvement to the article. The Red Pen of Doom "" ->"," none"

Two famous studios have released it at this point as well. 

Wikipedia Guidelines: The common theme in the notability guidelines is that there must be verifiable, objective evidence that the subject has received significant attention from independent sources to support a claim of notability. The absence of citations in an article (as distinct from the non-existence of sources) does not indicate that the subject is not notable.

Wikipedia Guideliens: No subject is automatically or inherently notable merely because it exists: The evidence must show the topic has gained significant independent coverage or recognition, and that this was not a mere short-term interest, nor a result of promotional activity or indiscriminate publicity, nor is the topic unsuitable for any other reason. Sources of evidence include recognized peer reviewed publications, credible and authoritative books, reputable media sources, and other reliable sources generally.

The Harbrace Guide to Writing books (both of them, published and distributed to colleges throughout the U.S. referencing the film) falls under credible and authoritative books.

Since I am a long-term donor of Wikipedia, it seems that this is a direct violation of what Wikipedia professes their site is. 'The Free Encyclopedia'. An Encyclopedia is a reference for documented, written sources. Together, all the sources add up to an article, which deems notability as referenced above.  I am not trying to be argumentative, but factual in what Wikipedia claims they are as a source, and what they have told me they are in terms of my donations as a supporter over the years.

 Peer Review Suggestion 

This article fails to make the rational connection between the date in 2012 and it's source in authentic Maya works. The date comes from a disputed correlation (GMT 584283) between the modern theory, by Mayanists, of a reconstructed ancient """"long-count"""" and the modern Gregorian calendar. The modern """"theory"""" of a """"long-count"""" was mostly derived in the late 1880's from one of three surviving Maya codices, namely the Dresden Codex. There are at least six direct astronomical statements about the 2012 time period in the Dresden codex. None of these are even remotely suggested by this article.

Thank you Gwen for re-stating my reply to Jdlund. I also complied with your previous block. As to Jimbo Wales and his claims of """"years of disruption on this article"""", those are his opinions, however, 70% of the facts in the article are based on my contributions, including my photos of the tower (before the university corrupted the tower with it's cages and remodeling the interior to something way beyond what it looked like at the time of the tragedy. Paint, cages and other cover-ups can not remove the actual history. Sure there have been previous wars over the content. I have been involved for over thirteen years getting the documents, interviews and real history of the tragedy, while trying to correct the media's versions, which are full of errors and out right misinformation. If some of the articles on the net and in the history of the media were used, Houston McCoy would be """"George McCoy"""", Whitman would be the Devil or evil (read Gary Lavergne's """"Why Did He Do IT"""" on his website (this is the author of """"A Sniper In The Tower"""", who claimed the tower tragedy was the """"Worst Mass Murder In American History"""", which I fought and proved that Andrew Kehoe was the worst until Whitman). Also, in Lavergne's article, he claims Whitman would be alive as of August 1, 2006, if the Supreme Court had not banned the death penalty a few years after the tragedy, even though Whitman had a Glioblastoma Grade IV brain tumor that would have killed him within a year - even if he had not gone up in the tower. All Jimbo Wales has ever done is react to the protests and misguided rule benders like BZUK and Gavia immer, who know nothing about the tragedy or the rules of a valid contribution. They (Gavia and BZUK), are just like Wales, memes who have no knowledge of what they are doing, just applying their own personal bias' for what they blindly consider acts of vandalism, with no proof, and not even looking at the contribution and it's sourcing.

"It's not that nefarious. His deletion started out as rewordings. You can read the article history for the sequence. I am responsible for some of the strange indentation on the talk page section; I captured his 14 diffs from the outset and attempted to reason with Q, diff by diff; eventually  I attempted to recast his edits into inline tags; I annotated the disputed words, such as 'must' (current article) versus 'should'  (Q.g.s. rewording), etc. So you can see Qs views started out reasonably. 
As Q proceeded down the article, he started deleting entire paragraphs, etc. So we stepped in per WP:BRD… That got his attention. Q decorated the article with top-level tags.  We started discussion, change by change. Q is fundamentally a well-read humanist. He has a theory of science based on his voluminous reading and training in history. So we have a difference in perspective which I would like to explore with Q and incorporate in the article. I attempted to get him to formulate his POV but Q's responses became attacks,  so I called Time out. To me, this proves Q is well-meaning, but Q also has strong opinions which I am attempting to draw out, somehow, without sacrificing the article.   The article remained tagged for over a month. The article is basically back to the Jan 1 state, but it also includes Tetrast's latest improvements.
Qs reasoning boils down to 'There was Science thousands of years ago. Therefore there was scientific method thousands of years ago', which does not follow. But we were never able to draw that out of him in so many words. Q is also capable of categorical statements but does not follow up with sufficient detail to be convincing; he just got frustrated, unfortunately.

 There are other ways to source besides pointing to Reddit chatter.

This SOURCE is only 1 day old; Two general partners at the venture capital firm (John Doerr and Beth Seidenberg) interviews about the gender-discrimination lawsuit. You can add it to the WIKI. It mentions there was a very good work relation ship with Ellen Pao while she was Chief of Staff. A relationship trusting enough to promote Ellen Pao to an partnership/investor. It's a situation that didn't work out and left some hurt feelings in the process. Some of you are complaining about """"intense criticism"""" in the WIKI, but these are direct NEWS sources.

"Mathematicians hired to monitor transactions 

I removed the following part of the article:

 Business.dk reported that the bank has a team of mathematicians employed to surveil the clients' trading patterns.

Saxo Bank is not doing anything untraditional in employing mathematicians, since indeed most larger financial institutions employ a number of mathematicians, economists and even physicists. To a lay reader this may sound incriminating or disturbing, but the main task of these employees is in fact to improve the trading systems performance in relation to speed and pricing, and safety in relation to sniping and other unauthorized activity. 

Furthermore, the secret source in the business.dk article referenced claims that Saxo employs these mathematicians to monitor individual trading patterns (in order to take unfair advantage of customers). However, and this is not stated in the business.dk article: Saxo shows the same two-sided price, for the same amount, at the same time, to any and all clients trading. This means that no single clients trading pattern is of interest. 

Therefore the accusation in the business.dk article is not only wrong, but also shows the lack of insight from the secret source and the journalist who wrote it. The fact that an article was brought in an online newspaper does not excuse wrong information. In relation to this particular statement regarding the role of the employed mathematicians, therefore, the article is in my opinion an unreliable source, in accordance with the Wikipedia principles of WP:IRS

Either this information regarding the widespread use of mathematicians among larger financial institutions, and regarding Saxo showing the two-sided price etc. should be included, (which I originally did until it was removed) to clarify to the lay reader that this is not uncommon or suspicious, and correct the mistaken information in the business.dk article, or the information about employing mathematicians should be left out completely, to preserve the neutrality of the article. ->"," none"

"Hi Scott, 

Jim Heller here.  I tried to contact you before a few times but to no avail.  Sometimes I've just wanted to say hi, others I had a question concerning the early online ex-premie days.  I recall how one of the last things you told me before you bid adieu to the ex scene was that exposing Rawat felt at odds with your Quaker and ACIM beliefs and I assume you still feel like that.  Anyway, I trust you're well.  That picture on your website is the essence of happiness!

I'm bothering you now though, Scott, for a particular reason.  One of the premies editing the Prem Rawat article is alleging that the Mishler radio interview is a fake and I wonder if you'd be so kind as to drop in to that talk page and explain what happened.  

Thanks, 

Jim

I would welcome a good-faith attempt by anyone to cast this material in a more acceptable light, as was suggested regarding the Thomas Mann article.

hey warrens, fuck you too. """"Uncivil manner, means me trying to elaborate on my arguments and getting  revert on revert that's what uncivil means. So yeah your a big winner champ and won't get banned. Asshole. 

Since the vista article contains information about the anti trust situation which, since it seems some people here have got a mouthful of gate's balls, is mislabelled anti trust controversy. Not really a controversy though is it when a court elected by over two hundred million people issues a decision, it'a court ruling, like it or not there's no controversy too that. Otherwise we should renaim the ted bundy trial, to the tend bundy controversy, since any court ruling merits this label. 

Since there's a section on anti trust laws and vista, it's worth noting the recent news that microsoft are going to be paying a hefty daily fine for completely ignoring the court's injuction. And this does have bearing on vista. You can't quote the m.s. pr saying we don't know what they want us to do, it's all questions, or whatever else he mentioned, without an adjunct sentence, of the head official regulating the anti trust actions quoting him too saying that our injuctions are crystal clear yet ms has ignored them for over two years now. 

But of course this has no bearing if this article is supposed to be a showcase for vista.

So like i said, if some fuckers had gone into the trouble of actually discussing any of that instead of reverted every single edit in a hitleric fashion, things would be different.

But for now this stategy of being a hawk on an article I wish to keep in a certain way, and being completely uncivil and rude about it, merits from my part a roayl, fuck y's all, take your mouths off of gate's balls and then we can talk.

I take offense with the view of some members here that some countries are happier than they """"should be."""" 
To be honest, I see nothing wrong with a study that asks people whether they're happy or not, then compiles the results. If people in Colombia consider themselves happier than people in Russia, that's their decision. 
This index is not a matter of researchers deciding which countries are the happiest, then listing their opinions. It's the product of surveys of the citizens within those countries, if I read the page right.
Sure, you might wonder why the endangered, malnourished citizens of Colombia are happier than the well-educated, protected citizens of Russia. Nevertheless, it does little good to go up to a Colombian and say, """"you shouldn't be happy! Look at all these statistics on your country!"""" or approach a Russian and say, """"Well, based on your literacy and your income, shouldn't you be happier?"""" 
People might not know much, but they do know whether or not they're happy. With that in mind, I don't see any problems with a study that asks citizens if they're satisfied with life, then compares the responses across countries.

 Tips for developing country outlines 

Instructions for developing country outlines is located at  

 A note concerning redlinks... 

Many of the entries (and their links) are standard across all of the country outlines, to aid readers, especially young readers, in comparing countries to each other.

So if this country doesn't have any of a particular entry, like navies, please don't delete the entry.  Instead, complete it with """"none"""" (and a brief explanation as to why, for example, """"- x is a landlocked country with no ports"""").  If the explanation exists in an article on Wikipedia, then click on the redlink and create a redirect to that location.  See Wikipedia:Redirect, WP:Section linking, and Help:Section#Section_linking.

Standard redlinks (article names) were also chosen based on how country coverage tipically expands.  This makes the standard names for these subtopics widely available and easily accessible.  So please do not remove those redlinks, for they will turn blue eventually.  In the meantime, they can be redirected to the section of whatever article has the relevant information, if any.  See Wikipedia:Redirect, WP:Section linking, and Help:Section#Section_linking.

Thank you.The Transhumanist    

P.S.: To discuss the standard design of the country outlines, or of outlines in general, do so on the Outline of knowledge WikiProject talk page.

 Guidelines for outlines 

Guidelines for the development of outlines are being drafted at User:The Transhumanist/Outline of knowledge.

Your input and feedback is welcomed and encouraged.The Transhumanist    

 Please check and fix the government section 

The government section needs to be checked for accuracy.  The initial data placed in the government branches sections was generated by template, and the data didn't fit all countries.

So those sections need to be looked over, and fixed if needed.

Please help.

Hi. While it's great that you want to contribute to Wikipedia, there is a whole host of problems with your article which you might want to consider. First, you have eliminated the redirect to another page, but haven't put in a hatnote or anything that will indicate to the reader where that page is.

This article focuses on the military campaign, while the American Revolution covers the origins of the war, as well as other social and political issues.

Please try to keep this article at a reasonable length. The current approach has been to summarize the war in a way that will be clearly understandable to the general reader, without cluttering it up with too many details. Concentrate on the major figures and actions, and try to leave detailed discussion of war strategies, battle casualties, historical debates, etc. to linked articles about specific battles or actions.

Instead of adding additional detail to this lengthy article, consider adding your information to an article on a specific battle, or to one of these campaign articles currently in development. Additionally, one campaign, Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga (box at right), does not yet have an article specifically about those operations. Perhaps you will start it Miguel!

NPOV

Reading this article it looks like the US won the war solo, with some assistance (which was mostly inept) from some other countries, one of which happened to be France.  This is evident in the introduction and throughout the article.  The introduction is particularly blatant, mentioning non-American intervention only as an after thought.  Should the WWI and WWII articles mention American intervention as an afterthought too? Am I the only one to think this is a problem?   

I have edited the intro so that it is less laughable.    
I agree especially Yorktown   

Casualties
I think that the casualty figures in this article are incorrect, as 25,000 Americans died in all, and 24,000 British and their allies.

I'm currently interested in just the principles involved in the radio signal scenario... and what conclusions inductive reasoning leads to.

I don't think it would be proper inductive reasoning to see a PNRS is caused by some intelligence, another PNRS is caused by intelligence, and to induce that the third PNRS is probably caused by some intelligence. There are unknown possible ways to generate a PNRS, and they cannot be ruled out simply because experience shows a couple other examples. This feels like the political approach to space shuttle launches about 10 years ago. Back in the day, designers speced the space shuttle to be safe for launch within a certain range of temperatures. Florida has uncooperative weather and often goes outside the safe range. Politicians wanted the shuttle to launch because it's good for elections. So, they pressure the upper management of NASA to launch outside the designed safe range. This happened a number of time without problem. At some point, management decided that the designers were wrong, and that a couple of launches outside their declared safe range meant that the real safe range was much wider. This continued for a few more launches until a space shuttle exploded on launch because it was too cold. If you shuffle a deck and pull 3 or 4 face cards in a row from the top of the deck, you can't really make any sort of probability measure as to what the next card will be. it could be a deck of only face cards. It could be many full decks. it could be a stacked deck. probabilities can't be determined off of a few rolls of the dice. two cases showing the PNRS was from an alien planet is not enough to make any sort of real probability estimate on the third PNRS. This is playing on a """"gut feeling"""" that people have when they're playing roulette. casino's will post the last 20 rolls. Some gamblers will see these numbers and look for some sort of """"pattern"""" and bet based off of that, on the """"gut feeling"""" that the roullette wheel has some bias. They may even win a few times. But the casino is better off if the wheel is truly random, so any """"patterns"""" is purely coincidental.  "" ->"," none"

 Once again, you are proving that you lack the ability to understand. If you had payed attention, you would have had realised that I actually removed that paragraph, because their Turkic origin is NOT disputed in mainstream sources. 
 I think that 90% of the people are not interested in their ethnic background, and especially not in their Turkic ethnic background, because they did not rule in the name of Turks, not had they any influence or some other kind of nationalst involvement in the history of the Turkic peoples. Not even Encyclopaedia Britannica (your favourite source) mentions their ethnic background: . 
 What's important is that the dynasty was started by a former slave, and that it rose out of the chaos that followed Seljuqid decline in Central Asia. It's absolutely unimportant whether Anushtigin was a Turk, a Mongol, a Chinese, or a Brazilian, because his descendants ruled as the """"Shahs of Khorezm"""" and not as the """"Turkic rulers of Turkistan"""". If someone is interested in Anushtigin's background, he can click on the link. The dynasty was certainly not """"Turkic"""", as you claim (and this is indeed bad faith), but only the dynasty's founder was (most likely) of Qipchaq origin. 
 In the article Mughals we agreed not to mention any ethnic lables, because the Mongolian origin of the dynasy's founder has no importance - the Mughals came from a Mongol background, but they were not Mongol rulers (in contrast to their Gengghizid ancestors). 
 I do not dispute authoritative sources, such as Iranica, who describe Anushtigin as a Turk. That'S why I have modified the Anush Tigin Gharchai article. But I do dispute POV claims that try to """"Turkify"""" a dynasty that was neither Turkic in language, nor in culture or identity.  "" ->"," none"

Here is a better example of the hypocrisy of British historians: When do you think WW2 started? With invasion of Poland, right? No! This is a mere British view of it. Poland was not the first county invaded by Hitler. The warfare started when Britain and France had sold Czechoslovakia to Hitler (read up on Munich Agreements, preferably not in wikipedia ;) ) with the invasion of Czechoslovakia. To deal with the shameful fact, the historians had just polished it out of the WW2 history. And now British public believes that the WW2 started at 1 Sep 1939. Hop! Britain is the knight in shining armour again! ... in the eyes of the British public at least. I know for a person with particular personality traits this might be hard to accept.

"Request to unblock Matthew2602 

Hey Hersfold, myself and other editors were discussing random things on the RuneScape Wiki IRC channel when somehow the conversation turned to User:Matthew2602 wondering if he could be unblocked here. I've known this user for quite some time now, and can vouch for him in saying that he is not a sockpuppet of that user, who neither him nor myself have heard of before his blocking. I think that it is safe to assume that the IP that both Matthew2602 and the sockpuppeteer was dynamic, and used by multiple users. Perhaps other users were also unjustly blocked during that case; who knows.

Once upon a time, I woke up one morning in July two years ago, only to find that I was blocked from editing on the only wiki that I was active on at the time, mylegonetwork.wikia.com. That wiki had about 20 active users then, and upon some very quick investigation it seemed that I had been caught up in the autoblock of a user who was blocked for one day for some minor policy violation. Anyways, I got an admin to unblock me and went on my merry way. A few hours later, when talking with him and other users on the IRC, I found out that he lives in the southern United States. I live in Alberta, Canada. We were both using the same IP. Beyond my nice little story, I've known User:Matthew2602 for months. I know that he is a good user with only good faith intentions, and I also know that he would like to be able to edit here again. It would be nice if he could be unblocked without large quantities of bureaucratic pointlessness, but that can happen if needed.

The Bakersfield Californian ^ | Feb 21 2007 | LEONEL MARTINEZ My catechism teacher, Sister Mary Lou Petrillo, was a smart and scrappy nun who drilled into us the basics of Catholicism without demeaning other Christian churches or religions. Too bad Sister Mary Lou isn't available to teach a few intensive lessons on tolerance to the campaign people of presidential candidate John Edwards. Within the last few weeks, two bloggers for the former North Carolina senator resigned after being hit with criticism from conservative Catholic organizations angered by past anti-Catholic remarks the bloggers posted on the Web, according to CNN. Melissa McEwan and Amanda Marcotte quit after groups like the Catholic...

Talk to Action ^ | Sun Jun 25, 2006 | By Bruce Wilson Hate speech is typically the first line of attack employed by bullies, but bullies become emboldened when eliminationalist rhetoric is tolerated, and that societal acceptance can lead to far worse things. I've previously covered hate speech - see Enough Hate Spech To Stun An Ox, and Hatecrime.org has an extensive collection of hate speech targeting homosexuals. Suprisingly - or not - at least one individual whose statements are featured in that archive ( and also in collections of antisemitic rhetoric ) is also leader of a prominent Christian right group that claims to fight against anti-Catholic bias and discrimination who...

Catholic League ^ | August 18, 2006 | Bill Donohue Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, offered the following comments today on the popularity of Catholic-bashing plays: “The Helen Hayes Theatre in New York must be experiencing hard times these days, otherwise it wouldn’t be home to ‘Kiki & Herb: Alive on Broadway.’ According to Variety, the play claims that the Catholic Church is run by the Nazis and that ‘the devil really does wear Prada’; the devil is the pope.

I'm not following Dennis' logic here. The reference entirely supports the information in the National alliance article (and by the way, that newspaper is at least a worthy enough source as the defunct obscure newspaper where Redwood's letter to the editor appeared that is quoted at length. This is what the Friedman article says:

He also suggested consulting with Political Research Associates (PRA), a left-liberal investigative outfit with deep roots in the counterintelligence movement. Among its top researchers is former Public Eye editor Chip Berlet. PRA has been funded, in large part, by Richard Denis-a multi-millionaire Chicago commodities trader who was also one of the largest individual contributors to the Democratic Party in 1993. Bragging that he and researchers had worked with PRA """"for many years,"""" King said: """"They have the best files in the country on political cults.""""
.........
Berlet, like King, has suspiciously changed his public views on NAP over the years. In 1984, when he first took over as editor of Public Eye, Berlet told Newman in a phone interview set up at Berlet's request to set the record straight regarding the Public Eye's 1977 accusation that Newman was a cultist and a LaRouchite, """"I'm the new kid on the block at Public Eye. I'm the new editor as opposed to the old editor, and if there was some way I could avoid having to write articles about this ongoing topic [NAP], I would. Our analysis of your group has changed over the past few years, drastically with my assumption to editor."""" The next issue of Public Eye contained the following editor's note: """"As you will learn from a forthcoming article on Fred Newman and the IWP [International Workers Party, a group that Newman had headed up in the mid seventies], the Public Eye no longer feels it is accurate to call Newman's political network a cult.""""
That """"forthcoming"""" article, however, never appeared. Instead, three years later, right after Democratic Party high roller Denis contributed $75,000 to PRA, Berlet's Clouds Blur the Rainbow did.

Just because an article mentions (and cites) that the subject is controversial, does NOT mean it should be deleted. As a matter of fact, most wikipedia articles do mention anything controversial about the article. It is people who delete these sections that have a bias and an opinion, such as yourself....as if you don't want people to know that there is a controversy. That is against wikipedia's neutrality policy. This is very obvious with your recent edits to the BRIT MILAH page. On your discussion page it says that you are interested in JUDAISM, which means you probably have a bias. INTACTIVISM is actually in the Oxford AND Webster's dictionary as the fight to end circumcision. For you to say there are no sources is ridiculous. There are THOUSANDS of organizations around the world dedicated to ending male AND FEMALE circumcision. Of course, since you are """"interested"""" in Judaism I don't expect you to stop editting BRIT MILAH the way YOU want it to be anyway so I give up.

"Dear Readers, I have been forced to make some editorial changes due to the attack on my reputation. It is my personal opinion that the previous article is a smear job and attempts to slander my good name. A few points. Moving from Toronto to B.C was for one sole reason and that was to find work. There is no record of a criminal charge on my record of the so called soliciting a prostitute charge, thus it is not right to say so. I ask anyone to prove my criminal record includes such a charge. Furtermore while it is wholly true I have emailed the CPC and former YCl members, but not for some time and it is not a regular hobby. As a former communist I am concerned about any attempt to re-build that movement. Furthermore I am not a member of the pro-life board anymore and have not worked for Campaign Life since 2001. I still hold my persoanl views on the matter of abortion, and that is my right.
It has been stated in the press that the homosexual man beaten in that park was in fact participating in questionable behaviour in that park that media admits is frequented by gays. I in no way agree with the assualt what so ever and have never said such! Finally this question about pictures. The Manning picture was taken during a federal election and that is all. I do not force my self on political leaders and the picture was voluntary on Mannings part. Please prove otherwise.
Once last thing re the Mulroney dinner. I was not dressed as chef, that was John Clarke not me. I simply walked into the room and towards the podium. I did not nor was I ever in the kitchen at any time. I suggest you check the archives of the Toronto Star and Toronto SUN.
In addition I am seeking a legal judgement against the pro-choice action network for their slanderous article and I would ask politely that you not link to it.
I am making every effort here to be accomodating and would ask the same please of Wiklepdia.

"Some problems with Soviet and Russian casualty statistics 

1-Partisan & Militia deaths of 400,000 are included with civilian deaths.
2 –POW losses of 1.6 million are included with civilian dead.
3- Losses of   2.3 million in western Byelorussia & Ukraine are included with Poland by western historians. The Russians include these losses with the USSR. To avoid duplication these losses need to backed out of Soviet or Polish losses.
4- To arrive at the total loss of 26.6 million the Russians assume only 450,000 persons emigrating after WW2. The actual emigration was about 1 million which means losses were overstated by about 600,000.
5-The Soviet population recorded in the 1939 census was 168.5 million not 170.5 million. Stalin ordered the number to be falsified.
6- Soviet civilian losses of  about 3 million persons due to famine in the territory not occupied by the Germans are included in the total losses of 26.6 million. .
7-The Germans had 1 million Soviet deserters in their Army. 215,000 were killed in action. The need to be included with German losses
8- In addition to the war losses of 26.6 million the Russians and the PC crowd in the west  tend  to ignore the1.7 million Soviet citizens that died due to communist terror ( I realize is not NPV but it is a fact that can’t be ignored)
9-Rule of thumb should be to check and analyze Soviet & Russian claims of losses. They throw a figure at you and expect it to be accepted as “ official” “ how dare you question official government data” Berndd ->"," none"

I guess this means you will be crying about the Nazis anymore.  What is your problem with Nazis anyway?  Did you date a Nazi woman and she broke your heart??  What a shame!!!

Your life isn't worth living anymore so pleasee KILL YOURSELF!

You know I'm right.  You've felt this way for a long time.  You've probably been thinking about killing yourself for quite some time.  I'm here to tell you, it's all right.  Go ahead.  Do it.  It won't hurt. Be brave.  All your troubles will be over.  You won't have the pain anymore.  Everyone else?  Don't worry, they'll get by.  

What do you mean It's not your fault things turned out badly?  It certainly IS your fault.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself for what you've done  - and failed to do.  Maybe things could have changed if you weren't such  a weakling.  You're defective.  You've been that way for a long time.  You are proof that God makes mistakes.

See how important reading the title, and getting the correct title is?

I've seen your majority view point and called it a farce many times. Grey Fox - I have proof for how the """"2008 Georgia War"""" is biased; it is biased because it IMPLIES that South Ossetia was a De Facto part of Georgia - which as we all know is bullshit, because if a region is De Facto and De Jure part of a country - there is no war! My Russian colleagues may disagree, but Chechnya was not De Facto part of Russia in the 1990's, it was De Jure. And it was called the Second Chechen War, not the Russian War 1999-2006. So in other words Mr. Grey Fox, and the other two of you, you have FAILED to show my how 2008 South Ossetia War is NPOV, but I HAVE shown you, and cited an example of how 2008 Georgia War would be incorrect and biased.

= More a fault of interpretation  

Mr Shyamal, 

In your answer, one notices very well that you still made an error, because you fix yourselves on the imaginary scientific value of Rognes or of the americains, by hating the objective value of the other authors and in particular of Lehrer.  To better explain you the taxonomic situation of the kind Bengalia s. str., I request from you do not consider that I insult certain characters of current taxonomy and to see reality exactly exposed by me. 

No author who occupied himself more or less tangentially with Bengaliidae, admits that Bengalia testacea  R.D. is the species-type of the Bengalia kind.  Only Rognes, which copied Sabrosky (1999:62), which knew this group of dipterous in same measurement as Rognes, wrote (with the collaboration of bibliographical and nonscientific impostors:  Neal L Evenhuis and F.C. Thompson) that this type is the nomen nudum  B. testacea  indicated by Duponchel (1842)(?!).  Thus, which makes N.L Evenhuis, J. E. O' Hara, T. Pape and A. C. Pont are only of copy and to transcribe exactly the silly things of Sabrosky, without any proof or analyze scientific.  Moreover, because these authors are good friends with Rognes, it also added """" Valid genus [ tests  Rognes (2006:467) ] """", but not validates species-type.  But, can you say which tests was made by Rognes?,  who knows nothing on Bengaliidae, which made the most stupid silly things in its work, which does not know the morphological terminology of their genitalia male, which mixes the drawings of the authors for the different species to make its new taxa, which makes the photography of the microscopic preparations of the species studied by Lehrer and deposited in the Natural history museum of London and which affirms that those are clean taxonomic imaginations?  Don't you believe my assertions?  Then I recommend to you to read, for a good documentation of your encyclopaedia, work of Lehrer of his review Fragmenta Dipterologica:  2008(18):1-4;  2010(23):1-22 and 22-25; 2010(24):20-24 and 24-30;  2010(25):1-4 and work:  LEHRER & WEI, 2010, a new Eastern kind of the family Bengaliidae (Diptera) - Bull. Ploughshare ent.  Mulhouse, 66(2)21-25.  
Thus you can understand that Rognes is incomparable being unaware of, which wanted to make taxonomic """" revolutions """" with the language devoted to its handicapped pupils of the school of Stavanger (Norway) where it works and with the mystifications of literature and information.  Moreover, you can consider only the work of Evenhuis &Comp.;  of Zootaxa an authority in the taxonomy of Bengaliidae constitutes, because they never studied the species of the group and in particular ?, because all the authors, of Zumpt (1956) and until Lehrer (2010) consider that Bengalia labiata  R.D. is the species-type of the Bengalia kind.  If you want to mislead the readers, you are free to depreciate your Wikipedia.

If they are notable, find a source that says that they are notable. These list of favorite players should be removed from this page, as well as from the other position articles. Dil 

Who says these players are notable? What criteria is being used to determine who is or isn't notable?
It's completely unsourced POV. Come to some consensus criteria for what is going to be considered notable, and then add players back along with sources showing they meet these criteria. These sections are completely unacceptable per WP:A as they are currently written. Dil 
The notable player section is pure WP:OR and even if they meet a standard (say All star game the year before), there'll be other standards that makes other players notable.    

See the soccer positions those all have lists and these lists can let people easily see some famous players without having to see another page. The standard is those players have won awards before such as All-Stars such as Tony Parker, MVPs such as Steve Nash or All-NBA teams Steve Nash and Billups. New England(Black Harry) also agrees with me and to prove it see:Talk:Power forward (basketball).  
That's circular logic...Because soccer players have it, basketball players should?   Just because another user agrees with you means it should be in there.   I'm opposing based on the notion that wikipedia should not be setting the criteria on who is a notable PG and who is not.    

Regarding soccer positions, WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS. 
If it's a list of players that have won MVP's, gone to All-Star games, or made the All-NBA team...then it should say that it is a list of those things, not that they are """"notable."""" Without clarification, it's just going to be a section which is constantly in a state of edit-warring because people want to see their favorite players on the list.  Also, please note that I started a new discussion on Wikipedia talk:WikiProject National Basketball Association. This isn't something that should be decided on an article talk page if the resulting consensus is going to affect multiple pages within the scope of a project.  Dil 

There is no need to describe the other point guards who have won the MVP as """"much shorter."""" Oscar Robertson was also tall for the position at 6'5. Steve Nash is taller than many point guards at 6'3. Magic Johnson was an anamoly at pg because he was so tall.  It is confusing to describe the others as short simply because they did not have his height. —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)

I've been in communication with them all  and was completing an email to Jimmy Wales re the report (it is about, ironically Admin abuse of power, the culture within, and the source of the attrition issues facing WMF for the past 3 years).  In short THEY (formerly YOU)  set an example of bullying behavior.  That's not important.  .  Part of the research process requires me to invoke the best and worst behavior in order to have data for the study.  DangerousPanda just blocked me for 60 hours and I have been keeping Sue, Jimmy, the Stewards and Oversight up to date... I had a report due into them over 90 mins ago.  What am I going to do now? HELP!  Thanks  Dr. Matt Hogendobler     User:PresidentistVB  

P. S. He's bragging about it in the Admin noticeboards group.  Fortunately for him, there's another admin with some sense to share with him.  This is perfect data!  But I am still in jail and I don't dare call Sue on a Sunday.

 He cannot; he's been blocked (by me) for a whole whackload of reasons that are painfully obvious to all  the panda  ₯’ 

 ...and he's removed his block notice.  I'll let someone else take care of that  the panda  ₯’ 

 Er, lest there be any confusion or misunderstanding, blocked users are free to remove block notices from their own talk pages.  There is no requirement that they wear a scarlet letter for the duration of their block, so for the moment there is nothing to """"take care of"""".  Encouraging someone else to go to his talk page and replace the block notice is just poking the bear.  (And it's pretty obvious that this particular editor is already more than sufficiently wound up....)

I've added article to """"watch list"""" for the moment, and may try to marginally contribute. I don't pretend to understand subject with slightest depth, and would be cautious.

The larger problem is in its organization. 

A general reader wants to know, immediately, what are the potential consequences of El Nino. Instead, the article's lead grafs launch  into a long-winded and seemingly vague description of its history and theory that are more appropriate for deep into its body.

"Jane Austen's 

Hi, I happen to have Tony1's talk page on my Watchlist left over from some ancient exchange, so I noticed your query about removing the full dates of birth and death of Jane Austen. Discouraging (without banning) month and day of birth or death is not consensus, although it is the strong opinion of many editors, disputed by many others, at at a straw poll currently being  conducted at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers). Since Jane Austen's editors have apparently decided against having an Information Box (which could display exact birthday and date of death), I think the argument for keeping them quickly accessible in this particular lead is rather stronger. And although I'm more of a Dickensian than an Austenite myself, I know several people in the San Francisco Bay Area who diligently celebrate Jane Austen's birthday with an annual ball. So in my book her birthday would fall in the same class as that of Abraham Lincoln (Kentucky, February 12, 1809 — Washington, D.C., April 15, 1865). ->"," none"

Randal """"Randy"""" Keith Orton[4][5] (born on April 1, 1980)[2] is an American professional wrestler currently signed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) wrestling on its Raw brand.[6] Orton is a third-generation professional wrestler; his grandfather Bob Orton, Sr., father """"Cowboy"""" Bob Orton, as well as his uncle Barry O, all competed in the professional wrestling industry.[7]

Before being promoted to the main WWE roster, Orton trained in and wrestled for Mid-Missouri Wrestling Association-Southern Illinois Conference Wrestling for a month. He was then sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). There, Orton became OVW Hardcore Champion on two separate occasions.[8]

After signing with WWE, Orton became a member of the stable Evolution, which quickly led to him capturing his first title with the company.[9] Orton also acquired the moniker """"Legend Killer"""" during a storyline where he began disrespecting Hall of Famers and physically attacking veterans of professional wrestling outside of appropriate restrictions.[1] In 2004, Orton became the youngest World Heavyweight Champion, when he won the title at the age of twenty-four.[10] His title win resulted in his departure from Evolution and feud with his former stablemates. In 2006, Orton joined forces with Edge in a tag team known as Rated-RKO. As a team, Orton and Edge held the World Tag Team Championship.[11] After the team disbanded, Orton, during the fall of 2007, won the WWE Championship twice in one night.[6]

Early life
Orton was born on April 1, 1980 in Knoxville, Tennessee.[2] Son to Elaine and """"Cowboy"""" Bob Orton,[12] he is the eldest of two siblings—Becky and Nathan.[13] Knowing from experience the hardships of life as a professional wrestler, Orton's parents tried to convince him to stay away from wrestling, and his father warned him that life in the ring meant a life on the road, away from family.[1] Orton attended Hazelwood Central High School, where he was an amateur wrestler.[1] After graduating from Hazelwood in 1998,[5] Orton enlisted with the United States Marine Corps. There, he was dishonorably discharged a year later, after going AWOL on two separate occasions and disobeying an order from a commanding officer.[14] Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Private First Class Orton was tried and convicted under a special court-martial and was put into a military prison for thirty-eight days.[12]

Career

Wrestling training
Orton first made his professional wrestling debut in 2000 with Mid-Missouri Wrestling Association-Southern Illinois Conference Wrestling (MMWA-SICW) in St. Louis, Missouri, an organization that was an off-shoot of the old St. Louis Wrestling Club headed by Sam Muchnick.[3] There, he was trained by both the promotion and his father, Cowboy Bob Orton.[12] During this time, Orton performed in matches with wrestlers such as Ace Strange and Mark Bland.[3][15] He worked at MMWA-SICW for a month.[15] Orton then refereed a few matches with World Organized Wrestling, a promotion where his uncle Barry Orton worked.[16] In 2001, Orton signed a deal with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and was sent to their farm territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued his training. During his time in OVW, Orton wrestled the likes of Rico Constantino and The Prototype and teamed with Bobby Eaton during a tag team title tournament. He won the OVW Hardcore Champion on two separate occasions by defeating Mr. Black on February 14, 2001 and Flash Flanagan on May 5, 2001.[8]

In response to User Hoary's topic The term """"Ebonics"""" and the appearance of a legal threat

Ernie Smith writes

I maintain that those who view and use the word Ebonics as being a synonym for BE, AAVE and other English language based appellations, are either totally ignorant of the origin and true meaning of the word Ebonics or they are fully aware of the origin and true meaning of the word Ebonics and elect to use word Ebonics as a synonym for BE, AAVE and other English language based appellations, with the intent to deceive. Since by definition to counterfeit is to: “try to deceive by pretense or dissembling.” the propagation of a false definition of the word ‘Ebonics’ as being a synonym for BE, AAVE other English language based appellations, with the intent to deceive, is larcenous counterfeiting. Given that by definition """"to steal and pass off the ideas or words of another as one’s own"""" and using a """"created production without crediting the source"""" is plagiarism or literary theft, when use is made of the word Ebonics (an original idea and word coined by Dr. Robert Williams as a synonym for BE, AAVE and other English language based appellations, this deceptive pattern of practice is ‘plagiaristic’ dishonesty or ‘literary theft’ that violates national and international laws protecting ‘intellectual property’ rights. This kind of plagiarism or stealth of ‘intellectual property’ via literary theft and the intentional perversion of the truth should not be tolerated and the authors of articles and books as well as publishers of dictionaries including Wikipedia, progating counterfeit and plagiaristic definitions of the word Ebonics must be held accountable.

Also I need to take note to stay away from low ranked video game pages and focus on popular until you guys get tired of the act.

Citations and External Link
I checked all the links and they work; which is good. Conversely, the 'Chronicles' definitely should not be listed as an external link. There are many other relevant links regarding the Round Table. A forum posting should not be used as something reliable. Also we should continue to discuss the state of the 'Contributing Attendees.' I checked some of the names and they had third party sources. Should they be added again since all Wikipedia needs is third party sources.   
Thanks for the check. I disagree about deleting the Chronicle website link. The 2007 THE article establishes that that discussion is notable. Yes, it is anonymous, but it is a discussion board for active academics. A truck driver would not be able to construct a useful post for that thread. And anonymity has virtues as well as vices: anonymity makes it possible to say what you really think without fear of reprisal, though at the risk that people will spread misinformation without fear of getting caught. Many of the posters in that Chronicle thread have track records in other threads that make what they say more reliable than it would otherwise bekind of like Wikipedia.
As for the """"Contributing Attendees,"""" I am skeptical that we can create something that isn't Listcruft, but it would be a lot easier to evaluate if you proposed a specific edit with genuine third-party sources.  

 The CHE is not being used as a source. External links are different from sources.   

Well my problem with the Chronicle for Higher Learning is that it seems to be very odd to me for some reason. I just have read the 'External Link' requirement page and the Chronicle for Higher Learning breaks several of the rules. Please read WP:EL under 'Link to Be Avoided' and the Chronicle forum/discussion/blog breaks all of a good amount of rules. I was drawn to the External Links because when I was attempting to fine info regarding the Table, many other links that could not be cited in the article because of Wiki guidelines, seem like they are much more revelant than the Chronicle blog for External Links. I propose adding another link and removing the Chronicle link because it does not adhere to Wiki guidelines. Academic38, your statement regarding who posts to the board can neither be confirmed or denyed because the postings are anonymous and nothing can be proven. It could be truck drivers with no idea about what they are talking about or otherwise; that is why Wiki discourages forums as reliable External Links. More discussion needed, but I am going to suggest the Chronicle be removed. It is already referred to under the THE explanation and does not need to be listed as an 'External Link.'   

I read WP:EL and I don't see that it breaks any rules. What rules are you claiming it breaks? You really need a stronger argument than """"it seems to be very odd to me for some reason."""" The December 2007 THE story has already validated the Chronicle link.  

 , It's a bit rich to start invoking """"rules"""" here, when you have conspicuously failed to do so in response to repeated requests above.  In any event, as you yourself have pointed out here, there is a distinction to make between policies and guidelines.    

I disagree that the Times article justifies the link to a """"blog."""" It can be argued that it justifies a link to the 'Chronicles for Higher Education"""" website but not to a blog that God knows who started. Academic38, you claim that my only argument is """"it seems odd..."""", however this is not true. If you read carefully the WP:EL under the section """"Links To Be Avoided"""", you would have your answer as to why the link to the 'Chronicle' blog is not up to the guidelines at all. Nomoskedasticity, I am not attempting to use rules only when it seems fit. You and Academic38 are asking me to point out regulations in the posts above and yet now you are stating that even though the """"Chronicle"""" blog link breaks Wiki guidelines, I should be okay with it because I was having a discussion about other rules above.

I was trying not to bog down my statement with too many terms, in that the goal of my statement was that gender is not relevant in the term of pedophilia.

I was not isolating to just sex, but the full spectrum, making CSA the most appropriate term.

Secondly, Schindler's heroism is widely recognized all over the world, while Winton is mostly known by the British who are extremely well-known for loudly bragging about things they never accomplished. He is a purely media-made hero. And third of all, the children he saved were thrown out of their homes in Britain as soon as the war ended.

"Type 1 - missing the point 

Due to the general requirement of the use of some social engineering in this case (and normally in Type 0 vulnerabilities as well), many programmers have disregarded these holes as not terribly important. This misconception is sometimes applied to XSS holes in general (even though this is only one type of XSS) and there is often disagreement in the security community as to the importance of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
This section misses the entire point. If I wanted to grab cookies from users using some form of local JavaScript exploit (just an example, there are hundreds of other things possible), I could use a type 1 vulnerability on a forum or popular website in order to attack the maximum number of users. The social engineering side of it is therefore a side-note, as it only applies when an attacker is targeting one specific user - and even then if they know they frequent that site they don't have to social engineer them at all.

Furthermore, what's with the names in the exploit scenarios? I'm all for equality but I'd like to see names in there that are at least somewhat universally pronounceable and single-barrelled. Try something like Anne instead of Lorenzo de Medici. 86.14.89.251 ->"," none"

Speedy deletion of Ozgur Cebir
 A tag has been placed on Ozgur Cebir requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

""""A 1981 issue of the publication states unequivocally that “The Public Eye is produced in conjunction with the National Lawyers Guild Committee Against Government Repression and Police Crimes.” It also lists Chip Berlet as a managing editor.95 ...

[22]

An article in a 1981 issue of Military Police journal detailed the criminal careers of several National Lawyers Guild members as follows:

...Carlos Zapata who was killed in Denver by a bomb he was planting at a VFW hall on 22 March 1978. He was...involved in the National Lawyers Guild-sponsored ‘Police Crimes Task Force.’ 

Bernardine Dohrn, the much sought Weather Underground fugitive, was named student director for the National Lawyers’ Guild in 1967.  

NLG member, Stephen Mitchell Bingham, is being sought by the state of California and the FBI for smuggling a .380 automatic pistol to George Jackson in prison...

...Guild member Frank Eugenio Martinez...was a Loyola law student who was active in NLG projects at the college and on the streets. Suspiciously, Frank’s fingerprints ended up on several of the eight letter-bombs mailed to Denver police officers in

[23]
1973...His younger brother, Francisco Kiko Martinez, also an attorney, was killed in a car when a bomb they were transporting exploded.100

The article by Detective Arleigh McCree, a former military police officer who became Officer in Charge, Firearms and Explosives Unit of the Los Angeles Police Department, observes that “The NLG continues to act as a clearinghouse and as an apologist and defender for terrorists and terrorism.”

"""== Categories related to the National Audio Theatre Festivals page ==

It is unclear why a number of categories were removed from the National Audio Theater Festivals page. I can only assume that the person who made the changes did not read the page carefully. The remaining categories imply that the NATF is simply an American radio drama performance festival and """"artists collective"""".  

The festival is not a performance alone, but comprises a professional organization - not a """"collective"""" or amorphous """"group"""" - of audio engineers, sound artists, voice actors, playwrights and producers. Its yearly event, also known as the National Audio Theatre Festival, involves several days of instruction, training, special talks and other discussions on these topics. For example, training in sound mastering, sound production, voice acting.  The Friday night performance is the """"cherry on the sundae"""". 

It is one of the only conferences of its type worldwide. Many of the participants do NOT work on the radio at all, but in audio books, film or animation, and likewise, while all the training involves the audio arts, it is not just an """"audio drama festival"""". The upcoming 2011 festival, for example, will be focusing on voice acting in animation.

Several of the categories are rather egregious removals, such as """"Audio plays"""", """"radio drama"""", """"sound recording,"""" """"sound technology"""", and """"voice acting"""", for which NATF is one of the only national training grounds or gathering for professionals... and even as other pages in those categories that are affiliated with NATF or are similarly themed stay in those categories. I therefore have returned most of the categories back.

Good morning.  You have been involved in the periodic blocking of this IP.  See block log.

I gather from your temporary unblocks that you sometimes edit from this IP.  Given the pattern of vandalism and the recurrence despite repeated warnings, I have put an extended block on this IP.

mma is a quasi sport, with a strong commercial and artistic influence, from the largest org, and dana white. the forums are full of shills, and the whole thing is a sham to an extent. the bottom line is there is no service done to truth, in perpetuating the opinions of people like dana, who are irrelevant to decisions and who have no authority, and a vested interest in designed product. dana is bullshit. the shill fake journalists are bullshit. the american popular redneck fans are bullshit. whats real is the event, the scorecard, the judges decision, the weights, etc. 

its easy to post a ton of sources that refute the passage of machida vs davis as it has stood, but i shouldnt have to. the whole thing should be in a neutral perspective and not trade on bullshit such as danas opinion, 13/13 sites that dont include espn, fight metric being used to justify the assertion that machida outstruck davis (davis landed more blows in the crucial first two rounds), fight metric being used to assert efficiency (no justification is given in the link, just a button promising to do so, which yields nothing). this whole passage of davis vs machida is biased, and subject to the same rampant and ignorant waffle, masquerading as fact, as a mma forum. ->"," none"

"""Spinal manipulation is a regulated/controlled medical intervention and can only be performed by chiropractors and a limited number of physical medicine professionals. Prior to the adminstration of spinal manipulative therapy, absolute contraindications must be screened out.  These include inflammatory arthritides, fractures, dislocations, instabilities, bone weakening disorders, tumours, infections, acute trauma as well as various circulatory and neurological disorders. Although most contraindications apply only to spinal manipulation of the affected region, a few emergency conditions, such as visual field defects is an absolute contraindication spinal manipulative therapy.   In February 2008, the World Health Organization sponsored Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and its Associated Disorders, the largest and most comprehensive study on neck pain, diagnosis, prognosis and safety to date. This included a consensus of the top experts in the world whose findings were collated using a best-evidence synthesis, which addresses risk, prevention, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment risks and benefits. With respect to the association of VBA stroke and cervical manipulation the study concluded:

  Vertebrobasilar artery stroke is a rare event in the population.
  There is an association between vertebrobasilar artery stroke and chiropractic visits in those under 45 years of age.
There is also an association between vertebrobasilar artery stroke and use of primary care physician visits in all age groups.
no evidence of excess risk of VBA stroke associated chiropractic care.
 The increased risks of vertebrobasilar artery stroke associated with chiropractic and physician visits is likely explained by patients with vertebrobasilar dissection-related neck pain and headache consulting both chiropractors and primary care physicians before their VBA stroke.""""[http://www.fcer.org/html/News/bonejointdecade.htm  

A 2007 study which examined over 50 000 chiropractic spinal manipulations had no reports of serious adverse effects.   The most common minor side effect was  pain in the head, neck, arm or upper back; and stiffness of the neck, shoulder which occurred after, at worst, 16 in 1,000 (0.016%) treatments.  Furthermore, the authors concluded that the risk of serious adverse effects was, at worst, 6 per 100,000 (0.006%) spinal manipulations.   Despite the controversy and skepticism  regarding chiropractic spinal manipulation, the  World Health Organization states that  """"[when] employed skilfully and appropriately, chiropractic care is safe and effective for the prevention and management of a number of health problems.""""

Failing to keep everything up-to-date
Hey Guys,
I seem to notice that we I'm absent, NOT all of the stats, season summaries for teams, etc. are staying up-to-date. Take for example Richmond, their season summary has not been update even since I been overseas in Europe. I mean that I feel stressful that I'm the only one updating Collingwood's season summary and nobody else. Also with season summaries, I want to discuss with all of you about how if we should have ALL of the season summaries in either a list or Template:AFLGameDetailed form (I might already dicuss this here).  Another problem is that Wikipedians has been updating articles in various formats in which it really annoys me when I update stats myself. e.g. With the Win/Loss table, I seem to notice that some Wikipedians have NOT bold the margin e.g. """"Port Adelaide 138"""" rather than the preferred format """"Port Adelaide 138"""". I notice that one lazy Wikipedian has decide to only update the Win/Loss table for their favorite team () rather that both teams ( and ). I mean the whole idea is to keep the article up-to-date, it is? Speaking about updating in various formats, I seem to notice the ladder progression gets messy and untidy all of the time. I means that we should discuss this problem together on this page and settle down on ONE simple format that all of us Wikipedians can follow. One Final thing I want to talk about in this is NOT changing/removing that already occurred in the past, I mainly notice that with the Win/Loss table were vandals keeping removing the bold text with home teams and sometimes with the Ladder were people make up they own stats. Its drives me insane and people must start looking at the Ladder on the offical website here in order to update the Ladder on Wikipedia. I hope that you fellow Wikipedians take me seriously on this issue as I am finding it stressful enough updating many stats myself.
Thank you for your attention.

Re: Friends episodes articles.
I used the capitals used in the main List of Friends episodes page where prior editor(s) capitalized all the first letters of the titles.  I totally agree with your point though. I will take some time to format these correctly as well.
As for the debate about having an article for each episode, I have looked for episode summaries for Friends before and they are not very in depth.  What I was hoping to achieve in the wiki medium was to create relationships between plots and characters that may not be obvious in a regular 'summary' format.  As another example, considering the legacy of Star Trek (and the obvious abundance of info on the series on the 'net), I think the Wiki entries for episode guides did an exceptional and unique job.

 Star City 

I guess the reason I've been encountering you a lot lately is because I started editing articles to do with Russia (via the Soviet space program), and you seem to be the top contributor at WikiProject Russia. By the way, have you read Sue's recent message? 

I'm not sure what the big deal with Star City is, and why it's causing such big discussions.. but I think it might be related to the Korolev / Korolyov issue we're also discussing. That is, I believe there should be a preference to use usual English names, while you appear to have a preference for the default romanization. It seems to me, that """"Star City"""" is the English name for this region - whether incorporated or not. Notice on other language Wikipedias, including the Russian Wikipedia, they don't have two articles on the area.. after all, the Russian names are the same. Maybe there's a dispute here on English Wikipedia because the English name (the one originally used by NASA) is different from the default transliteration (just like Korolev / Korolyov).  

Basically, I think the definition of """"conventional English name"""" in WP:RUS isn't quite compatible with the usage in WP:COMMONNAME. In particular, WP:COMMONNAME doesn't require the sources to be """"dictionaries"""". But WP:RUS does require the sources to be dictionaries, and I believe this difference is causing problems. WP:RUS is not a key Policy or Guideline (maybe it's more like a WikiProject advice page, that achieved wide support in 2007); as such it should elaborate on the key policies, not change them. I think the """"dictionary"""" requirement should be reworded, to allow for situations where the place name doesn't occur in a dictionary, but can still has a conventional English name.

I'm generally not a fan of lengthy discussions over relatively insignificant issues, like the organization of """"Star City"""" articles, or what Korolyov (city) is named (I don't actually care very much). One of the reasons I've engaged in discussions with you, is because you are an experienced editor, who apparently oversees a huge number of Russian-related articles. I'd like to change your mind regarding WP:RUS - that we shouldn't be insisting on """"dictionaries"""".   "" ->"," none"

 MY STATEMENT 

AND WHAT IS IT I DID EXACTLY TO BE BANNED?
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN?
You are obviously not aware of what is goinf ´g on I am ban for not contributing at all with the talk page!! what ? I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with Igor Bogdanov, at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes.
I was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it.
But where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling Igor Bogdanov a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the 3RR rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by Bidhonene who is a very endeared friend of YBM, for not being so usefull as she wish.
An article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang.
Just as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the ´factual connection between YBM and this Voyer who infatuated this whole affair.
It was YBM who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this.
Bishonen blocked me 20 minutes after her protegé had been blocked.
i dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight.
You can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit.
She didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it.
She has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between  her liking and her work as an admi.
She does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much.
She even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff.
The arbitration should have been about this too.
They are using the fact that mediator Nicholas turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds.
And this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it.
He even insulted Nicholas turnbull.
Easy when people aren't there to defend themselves.
Wiki english is a spot on the face of Wikipédia, admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing.

This has to stop.
I asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate.
He has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request.
This don't go and has to be aborted.
I do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it.

None of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration.
It is a close debate and not an arena game.
THis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning.
He is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted.
He must be removed as well.
i dont accept what happened tonight. There was absolutly no reasons for me to be blocked and certainly not for 3 days.
If I say fuck! like ybm nothing happen, but if I bring precious evidencies, so I am ban and the evidencies confiscated and destroy yes, and detroyed as they have been alredy here several times.
This is the sign of a totalitarian system, and wiki english has became a totalitarian system, where the judged perform the judgement, and were all proofs are stollen and destroyed and were disturbing people are threaten for their meaning and impert to say more, and blocked away.

 Peer Review 

I missed the following comments which have been available for a few days and have put them here so that all is clear - please put them back if this is not procedure. A few brief comments:

 R says there is a way to go on WP:MOS which is his area of expertise. I assume if we address each of his points one by one then that should improve matters. He does not suggest going for GA but that is still an option.
 He thinks the UN references look reliable - but not sure if this is a comment on npov too.
 Perhaps we need additional comment on the subject area, npov and other aspects of the article as well as WP:MOS etc.

"﻿Sensual Pleasures of the MindItalic text

There are endless creative ways to provoke and capture sensual feelings. Money can’t buy it, you can’t see it or hold it, outer
packaging offers no competition for it and no grandiose flash of materialistic presence can incite it. Sensuality in it’s truest sense can only be felt within.  It is provoked by and through the power and brilliance of the mind. It is born there and lives there.

Since it is a feeling rather than a physical event, it is more difficult to achieve and maintain than might be found with other less deeply rooted sexual experiences.  Knowledge, intuition and creativity are the tools necessary to discover where it lives and how to awaken it, what it takes to stimulate it and how to nurture it so it will grow. A conscientious partner can create a need and cravings simply by using the power of the mind.    

All of this offers new meaning to the old adage about the mind being a terrible thing to waste. There are hot spots in the psyche that can be triggered by suggestion and connection. (Emotional Buttons)  Pushing those buttons engenders our partner's sensory and sexual experience. We do this by using one type of energy to spark another and by channeling emotional reactions into sexuality. Where the adventure leads is limited only by the knowledge, intuition and creativity an individual possesses. Nothing is written in stone and there is no list of how to’s.  It’s freelance flight.

Knowledge is power! Getting to know your partner and what makes her/him tick and tingle is the first step. The ability to
unearth these secret treasures comes from paying close attention to things you say or do that result in an action or reaction
indicating you have your finger on a button (hot spot). Finding all of those buttons, exploring the endless possibilities and
discovering the wondrous places they lead, takes patience and thought, but the rewards are immeasurable.

Having well honed intuition is a valuable asset. Liken it, if you will, to a good quarter back with a natural talent for reading the defense. If you ‘know’ what your partner needs, wants and desires without her/him having to explain it all, then you hold a powerful advantage. Possessing a good base knowledge of the opposite sex, in general, offers a continual win, win proposition

Being gifted with a creative imagination or obtaining skills in this arena will offer many positives for a lasting and pleasurable sex life. Desires and cravings are born in the mind and live there so it would make sense to use the power of the mind to it fullest to gain the greatest results. Spice and adventure are two major factors in all sexual experiences. If they are not on the top of your list of priorities then they should be. Avoiding boredom is key in creating cravings for more. If it wasn't good the first time, why would anyone want to repeat it?  Taking your partner to a place where she/he has never been before and making each experience a lasting memory should be primary goals. That is the stuff heroes are made of.

Sexual stimulation can be achieved and sustained through physical manipulation, sexual pleasures, or through mind play and manipulation A physical presence, a verbal exchange, a mere mental/emotional connection or any combination of all of the above can create an ‘altered mental state’, a place of arousal and euphoria.

Sensual/erotic tasks and journals are great avenues to maintain altered states. Rituals and sensual tasks , while away from your
partner can help keep the buttons pushed, the bond strong, keep the connection flowing and offer sexual stimulation on an
ongoing basis. Keeping your partner in an ‘altered state’ often and for as long as possible will help in creating cravings and lead to a path ultimate sexual pleasure.

Altered states....
1-Sexuality.....intensely 'turned on' riding a sexual high ...erotica.....consumed by passion
2-Endorphin high...... an altered state resulting from physical or intense mental stimulation.
3-Euphoria.....totally absorbed in your partner and the sensations and feelings being created.
5-Head space......spellbound/entranced..lost in the release of control..total freedom and flight..to be absorbed in the trust and acceptance..a peaceful place
6-Nirvana......meditative state.....heightened consciousness with loss of awareness.....having a sense of self through 'losing oneself'......total freedom through total loss of control.

All sexual experiences need to be consensual and remain safe. ->"," none"

Yes this song mentions the famine but it isn't actually """"about"""" the famine, the media hype thing up to no end, even the name """"Famine song"""" was coined by the media not by Rangers or Celtic fans.

The famine would be one such reason, but as that is over there is now nothing stopping them. It is not a demand to go home, merely a mocking suggestion.

Essex, Vermont as a City
Hi, thanks for your note. As I understand it its a municiple, political difference. City status doesn't automaticly come with size. This is clearer in the UK where there has to be a cathedral, a university and other factors (such as population size), then the Queen grants """"city"""" status. Here in the US I think its a little less rigorous, but the State grants the city """"status"""" if the town and state desire. I'm not sure what that status brings with it, but its likely to change the way the place is administered / financed and governed. I hope this helps  

According to the Vermont Citizens' Guide, (published by the Vermont League of Women Voters), """"The usual connotation of a city as a densely populated urban area is alien to Vermont.  Of the thirty largest local government units, only eight hold city charters and one must continue down the list to the 72nd largest community before reaching the ninth City of Vergennes with a population of 2,741 ... It is the form of government, not population, which distinguishes Vermont cities from towns.""""  Thus, it seems that something in Vermont is a city if and only if it has a city charter.

Hi RetroS1mone. Thanks for coming here to reply to Guido - it's no problem at all, especially when I'm not around. I replied to Guido above about the 3RR block. If Guido does take my advice to work on that table in his userspace, would you give him the time to marshall his arguments and listen to what he has to say? I know he does have COI with the activist organisation, but while strongly discouraged it is not forbidden to edit if you have a COI. See WP:COI and also Wikipedia:Suggestions for COI compliance. Me personally, I would prefer Guido edited chess articles and only participated on the talk pages of CFS/ME pages (or worked on the article about CFS activism that has been suggested). Oh, and you are quite right about the forum-shopping. Guido, if you have a complaint about conduct on those articles, you will need to find another admin and not come to my talk page. I've commented on the talk pages of some of these articles with suggestions about the content, and (for me) that makes me too involved as an editor to use my admin tools in relation to those articles. RetroS1mone, speaking as an editor and not an admin, I would advise you not to say things in edit summaries like """"tendentious editor with strong COI POV"""". The reason being that edit summaries are permanent records, and if you say something incorrect, you can't retract it. It is best to keep edit summaries focused on describing the content (not the editors) and then to say """"see talk"""" if you want to go into more detail. That way, if you are wrong, you can retract and apologise later. For the record, I think you are mostly right here (though I would have phrased it more diplomatically), but I hope you see my point about the difference between saying something in an edit summary and saying something on a talk page.

I just saw Xeno's edit comment - A Phone Call????? That's a reliable source that verified it for you???? You're a lousy editor, biased, obstructionist and fixed on defending your article. Fact is the claim was unsupported and unverified and should not be in here until such time as a Reliable Source was produced. You've been completely unable and incapable of providing a source yet more than happy to keep your edit by any means possible. Absolute garbage - and I detest your unsupported allegations that I'm a fucking teabagger, Republican or one-subject editor -ESPECIALLY since I provided supporting links to my NPOV editing. This is how you support an edit: You give it a proper name: Suncoast Regional Emmy Award /You give it a year: 2000. /You give it a title: A Grave Injustice /You give it a channel: WDSU, New Orleans - AND YOU PROVIDE A RELIABLE SOURCE: And you do it without bias according to supporting references. Your a biased hack, your attacks, ignorance, incompetence and obstructionism did nothing to better this article, they only serve to drive those you bully away from the project. Don't be a Dick. Oh, and the last 1/2 of the article is garbage fluff that serves no purpose other than to keep the guards and gatekeepers employed.

Objection to removal of text in real prices and ideal prices article

I object strongly that you have removed chunks of text, without proper explanation and discussion of your reasons, in the real prices and ideal prices article. It seems as though you are on an ideological campaign to cut stuff out of articles which you happen to think is rubbish.

black codes, in U.S. history, series of statutes passed by the ex-Confederate states, 1865–66, dealing with the status of the newly freed slaves. They varied greatly from state to state as to their harshness and restrictiveness. Although the codes granted certain basic civil rights to blacks (the right to marry, to own personal property, and to sue in court), they also provided for the segregation of public facilities and placed severe restrictions on the freedman's status as a free laborer, his right to own real estate, and his right to testify in court. Although some Northern states had black codes before the Civil War, this did not prevent many northerners from interpreting the codes as an attempt by the South to reenslave blacks. The Freedmen's Bureau prevented enforcement of the codes, which were later repealed by the radical Republican state governments. ->"," none"

Events don't need titles?
There is a common pratice by American television to label events as if it were a television programme.  Before the video footage is broadcast, often there is theme music and an elaborate title page that might say """"Crisis in Canada"""" or """"Terror in Iraq"""".  Is it subtle POV to have to label every event with a title.

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Five-Star-Between-The-Lines-257547.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

Agreed.  That area of the table needs some work, and is not fully consistent on the distinction.  It came about because """"scheduled"""" (which was formerly the word used in all future launches) was both clearly incorrect and also unsourced for many of the rows in the table.  

When I looked at a bunch of the sources about a month ago (2015-02-14), for most of the far future launches, the most one could say is that they were """"under contract""""; while some of the very near term future launches (one to three ahead in the queue) were both clearly """"scheduled"""" and also scheduled with the particular local and national authorities to make the near term date have some meaning.  So that is what led to my attempt to improve the article by having a three-way distinction: 
 """"Scheduled (with range & launch license authorities)""""
 """"Scheduled""""
 """"Under contract""""

It appears that most of that bold edit was left, and has remained, while some parts have been modified by other editors.

One of the most fundamental groups (sometimes referred to as being part of the """"Plymouth Brethren"""" or the """"Exclusive Brethren"""" although we much prefer something along the lines of, say, """"Christians"""") refers to their buildings as Gospel Halls. This is to eliminate confusion on the word """"church"""", which technically does not mean a building, but the body of true Christians. There's no seperate page on our group (although I'm considering starting one...) so I imagine some dedicated linker decided this page was the closest they could get.

 Sexuality discussion 

I was surprised to see the """"Sexuality"""" section I had created, so arbitrarily removed. I will not just revert that edit, instead I will bring the text here so that if anyone has substantive disagreements with the material we can work them out before it is re-added to the article. The old version was simply slanted and incorrect to boot, lumping discussions of his sexuality into the posthumous section, despite the fact that allusions and accusations raged well before there was anything posthumous about the man.
Sexuality
Bacon is widely acknowledged to have had romantic attachments to other males, and is today considered to have had homosexual tastes. Among the many modern authors acknowledging this aspect of his life are A .L. Rowse, A .L. Rowse, Homosexuals in History, New York: Carroll & Garf, 1977. page 44 Rictor Norton, Rictor Norton, """"Sir Francis Bacon"""", The Great Queens of History, updated 8 Jan. 2000 http://www.infopt.demon.co.uk/baconfra.htm, Alan Stewart, Jardine, Lisa; Stewart, Alan Hostage To Fortune: The Troubled Life of Francis Bacon Hill & Wang, 1999. page 148, Louis Crompton, Homosexuality and Civilization; pp388-391 and Joseph Cady. Nieves Mathews is among the few modern writers to take an opposing view,Mathews, Nieves Francis Bacon: The History of a Character Assassination, Yale University Press, 1996 claiming that the sources are not conclusive: (1) a quote from the private diary of Simonds D'Ewes (Bacon's enemy in Parliament, but considered to be a responsible and scrupulous lawyer), (2) a quote from Brief Lives by John Aubrey (written after Bacon's passing): he """"was a pederast"""" and """"had ganimeds and favourites"""", (3) and a note by Ann Bacon in which she expressed disapproval of the friends Francis and Anthony were associating with (since one was a """"Papist"""" and money was owned to her sons: """"that bloody Percy [who Bacon kept] as a coach companion and bed companion.""""). Coaches were one of the few private spaces at the time, thus the term """"coach companion"""" is a clear reference to sexual doings.

A few points if I may.

1)I wasn't really interested in this GW issue until I came here and realized how crappy the science was, and the writing, all of which based on models as far as the eye can see: the real quality of which is inversely proportional to the control of the information -mostly by people whose careers depend on it, namely modelers. 

2)As far as the table is concerned, like I said before, it's a unit increased in CO2, as in """"unit vector of change"""", for whatever use that might be, I just liked it; that's all it is. 

3)I'm also asking that if there is at least one single article, on any actual physical experiment, conducted in a microcosm, for instance, that could compliment the overwhelming propensity of models, it would be nice to include it here... provided it could get in. Seems the world is already being controlled by programmers.  "" ->"," none"

In my opinion, you're confusing different policies. You say that everything you write there is sourced; for the sake of the argument, I shan't dispute that (even though a very good point is raised there, regarding the difference between sourced and attributed). However, sourcing is required to comply with Wikipedia's policy on verifiability. Soapboxing, advocating and giving undue weight, on the contrary, are not permitted under Wikipedia's policy on neutrality. So, even if everything you state there is sourced, it still can't be included if it violates WP:NPOV.
It's not a matter of not liking what sources have to say; it's just that they are only opinions. I don't think criticism should be hidden or Amanda's guilt taken for granted. Actually, I don't even know if she did it, because, quite frankly, I never studied the case, but I'm convinced that if a Court of law convicted her, there must have been sufficient evidence to warrant that. Italy's not Soviet Russia... My point is that the article shouldn't mainly revolve around criticism of the trial or attempts at soiling Guede's reputation, by implying that he was a lone killer, as that, primarily, violates WP:BLP. Wikipedia is not there to retry Amanda. As I've said, I agree that criticism should be reported; it is notable and rather easily sourced. However, that should not be the focus of the article. 
Finally, as I wrote on the article's page, technically the trial record is publicly avalaible, but that doesn't mean that it was actually accessed or published (even in Italian, for that matters)...   ''''''  Let's talk 'bout it! "" ->"," none"

 Joseph McCabe criticisms - lack of NPOV 

I previously added criticism to this section from Joseph McCabe, drawing from his writings in """"History's Greatest Liars"""". This was dismissed as being a fringe viewpoint. This I disagree with. I'd first note the lack of criticism of St. Francis and Franciscans, demonstrating a lack of NPOV (something commented on by others), and also a conflict of interest in Marauder40 deleting these comments, where he seems to act with a conflict of interest, being a devoted Catholic and member of a Secular Franciscan order, as noted in his bio. I do not see him as someone to act with impartiality in considering criticisms of Franciscans.

I now look at whether Joseph McCabe's views can be considered as """"Fringe"""" Joseph McCabe has an entry in Wikipedia, n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_mccabe , and was himself a Franciscan Monk till the age of 19. He therefore draws on his own background in critiquing the Franciscans, and is a recognised scholar.

Of this particular comment, the origin is not Joseph McCabe alone, he draws from """"The Middle Ages"""" by Professor James Westfall Thompson, where on page 674 he says """"With wealth the old familiar evils that had corrupted the older orders corrupted the Franciscans and Dominicans too"""". He also draws upon the writings of Father Hoetzappel, a historian of the Franciscan order, not to mention his own pertinent background and experiences.

In this light, I consider the comment I introduced earlier as appropriate to Wikipedia, providing a range of views and importantly, criticism from a recognised scholar. In will engage in this talk page, but consider other processes within Wikipedia and seek the involvement of others within Wikipedia if need be.

The mediator turned out to have a srong bias. He could not fulfill the role of an impartial mediator, in my opinion. To say that rejecting a mediator who had openly expressed a strong bias is wrongful is just more bias on your part. I agree that Wikipedia is not an advocacy site, and that is the exact point I have tried to make.

"""  Why did you delete my correspondance without reply?  Maybe it was accidental...if so here it is again.

   Thanks for taking the time to explain Tokyogirl79.  I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's """"flat-earth society"""" type behaviour that I find objectionable.

I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called """"community"""".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the """"Speedy Deletion"""" I could find no such option.

When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for """"Nassim Haramein"""" and """"The Resonance Project"""" in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-""""free"""" encyclopedia. Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.

This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.

If I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?

With regard to your statement: """"Regarding the mediation, this would appear to be a situation of a few editors dissenting with a large consensus. Am I correct about that?""""

Some editors, like Matt Britt and Seraphimblade, still do strongly support the binary prefixes (but, to their credit, never edit warred over them). There was, however, an emerging consensus to allow the use of parenthetical disambiguation alongside legacy prefixes, as opposed to replacing them with binary prefixes. I'm convinced a workable solution can be devised if the edit warring stops.

You're not even Maltese, how do you expect to correctly edit a page about a person who's only notable in Malta? Sure, you can rely on articles you find online, but as you may have noticed, pretty much all the media is against Norman Lowell and his party, for obvious reasons. There's even a website dedicated to """"spreading the true agenda"""" or whatever  . But of course, everything you read is only partially factual and mostly biased... and rightfully so, but such information has no place on wikipedia. Perhaps you'd be interested in writing a """"criticism"""" section? That would make more sense.

On a side note, regarding the banning of Norman Lowell...it is well-known in Malta that Lowell was banned from the media, but unfortunately I could only find one source stating that. The person interviewed in the article is the editor of one of the most popular Maltese websites, www.maltafly.com, on which Lowell has been frequently made fun of.

Tony Sidaway is a confirmed and vocal scientologist who often writes lengthy usenet posts describing his involvement with the church of scientology and extolling its virtues.

Routinely, other bureaucratic fucks on wikipedia have blocked Tony. (log of blocks)

He also blocks others for reasons like """"Idiot"""", """"Particularly stupid troll"""" and an admin for """"Persistently flaunting a stupidly large signature with multiple image inclusions.""""

He also harasses banned users by reverting anything they write on their talk pages and protecting it simply by saying, """"they attempted to use their talk page.""""   Note: other wikipedia admins do this abuse, too.

He bans anyone who says the slightest thing even vaguely related to criticizing something even vaguely related to an admin.  He also hides what they say (example).

I don't know a thing about it and I don't care how many reliable sources I have how do I check to know they are even telling the truth if I don't even listen to Jazz or Kenny G who plays Smooth jazz. I leave it to people who know about that music and know about Kenny G. 

Another example I have never watched The O.C. but should I edit it to say it's a sci-fi show just because some reliable sources says it is? That's giving false info on something I don't know a thing about. I do know about One Tree Hill (TV series) and I will edit out  any one that would try to list it as a sci-fi show even if a reliable sources wants to say other wise. Why because ever one who has watched the show knows it's a Teen Drama and ever one agrees on that. 

Your a bands whole page when you don't even listen to the band and only know what someone else told you about them. I watch One Tree Hill I have all four senses on DVD I know a lot about the show I can edit it because I know what I'm talking about. I can't do the same with The O.C., Jazz music or the page about Kenney G no matter what reliable sources because I have know why of knowing if those sources are stating facts about the subject at hand.

April Fools' Day or All Fools' Day, though not a holiday in its own right, is a notable day celebrated in many countries on April 1. The day is marked by the commission of hoaxes and other practical jokes of varying sophistication on friends and neighbors, or sending them on fools' errands, the aim of which is to embarrass the gullible. In some countries, April Fools' jokes (also called """"April Fools"""") are only made before noon on April 1st.[1] It is also widely celebrated on the Internet. It has been declared that April Fool's for 2007 has been moved to April 2nd as so it will not conflict with Palm Sunday.

 Atomic Attacks on Japan 

I'm not sure this section is a good example of revisionism. The reason is, the """"old"""" view is still widely held and valid, the US certainly did drop the bomb to end the war quickly - it may have also had other motivations, which are now coming to light, which adds to a more nuanced picture of events. There will always be new perspectives and theories, just like in Decline of the Roman Empire, but these are not really revisionistic. Revisionism, strictly speaking, is where you take an established idea and discount it based on new evidence.  Otherwise it is just the normal process of better understanding the many nuances and complexity of history.

"That's an extremely selective quotation from the nutshell text.

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. ->"," toxic"

Well, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can't kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:

In recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today’s useful idiots. 

[Ali Sina] states: “They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.”  The same author writes: “More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, """"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."""" Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.” 

Muslims obviously don't like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. 

In Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech?  

Funny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. 

If you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? 

I am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? 

Sorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2 ->"," identity"

"Danny Green article peer review 

This article on UNC basketball player Danny Green has several strengths.  First, the information presented is very neutral and empirical  only statistics and facts are used to describe Green.  Also, it is very straightforward and comprehensible.  I have a fairly good idea of what kind of basketball player Green is just from reading the article.  However, it would be helpful to learn a little more about Green's background (childhood, recent news, and/or quotes by him or about him, etc).  It would also be improved with the addition of a couple of pictures of Green playing basketball to go along with the bio box on the right side of the page.  The article also fails to mention Green's father, who has many times gained as much attention as Danny and is a very significant story involving Danny that is not included in the article.  Lastly, almost all of the information provided about Green comes from one source  obviously the article would be better if there were a few more sources for it.   Sscline. ->"," none"

Hi. The issue here is very simple.  The article currently states there is """"NO"""" evidence that ECT causes brain damage in humans or animals.  The article also states that there are """"NO"""" recent reviews that found such evidence.  Both of these claims in the article have been proven to be grossly incorrect. Yet a paragraph is devoted to it.  Because such fallacious claims are made often however, a paragraph was written pointing out an example of a mouse study pointing to the contrary, and also cited a new study that found that ECT compromises normal cerbral blood flow in humans, possible evidence pointing to brain dysfunction.  The information is sound, supported, and appropriate given the subheading and the preceding paragraph that promotes gross misstatements of fact by saying that there is """"NO"""" evidence of brain damage in humans or animals, and """"NO"""" modern reviews pointing to such evidence. (And yes, there are reviews, as has been proven.)   

The progression of arguments to the contrary here is quite odd and revealing:

1) First the paragraph was too long and was trimmed down and a study removed.
2) Then there's an argument that the two studies don't directly relate to one another and shouldn't therefore be in the same paragraph, even though it's abundantly obvious why they are (to contradict previous paragraph finding """"NO"""" evidence in humans or animals, and provide an example of study finding brain damage in mice, and an example study finding compromised, abnormal cerebral blood flow in humans)
3) Then an argument that this mouse study should only be a minor footnote that no one will read (even though the reason it's there is to provide an example that yes, there IS evidence)
4) Then an attack is made on the design of the study, apparently suggesting that it isn't evidence because of the mouse strain chosen. (which I disagree with, and regardless it's not a wiki editor's place to challenge the mouse strain choice of expert neuroscientists who make this stuff their life's work  it's their study. Moreover, it isn't the superiority of the study that got it here, it was listed as an """"example"""" that YES THERE IS EVIDENCE IN ANIMAL MODELS OF BRAIN DAMAGE).
5) Then the claim is made that the mouse study struggles to support the paragraph.
6) Then the mouse study is called trivial until it's replicated (even though again it was added as an """"example"""" that YES, there is evidence, not because of overriding importance)
7) Then I pointed out in the talk page that one of the """"NO"""" evidence claims made in the preceding paragraph in the article is that there are no modern reviews finding evidence of brain damage. I proved this claim to be false, and cited to Peter Breggin, a very well-known MD who has written a book on the topic and a recent comprehensive review of the literature citing close to 200 references and finding numerous evidence of brain damage in animals.
8) Then Breggin is personally attacked, apparently suggesting that his published review isn't good enough to disprove the """"no evidence in recent reviews"""" claim, because he's not a """"reliable source."""" (I also point out that there are other reviews finding evidence, including one done in the Russian mouse study).
9) Then in response to me writing that there there either IS evidence of brain damage in animals or humans or there is not, and that a single study stating that brain damage was found in a modern study can defeat the harsh claim of """"NO"""" evidence of brain damage in animals, it's argued that """"that's not the way that science works"""", and """"several studies also can mean squat"""". 
10) Then it's argued I can't negate """"secondary"""" sources that found no evidence of brain damage in animals or humans with direct """"primary"""" sources of published experimental studies which found such damage as part of their experiment. (This is not to mention that there are also other published reviews finding evidence of brain damage in others' work).
11) etc.

In addition to this, it's claimed that this single paragraph briefly showing a couple studies pointing to possible adverse effects (the subheading IS Adverse Effects, btw), violates the Wikipedia policy of undue weight.  This is incredibly strange as the paragraph immediately before the new paragraph is entirely devoted to multiple claims of """"No evidence"""" of braind damge in humans OR animals.  If a paragraph can be devoted to """"No evidence"""" stating untruths, then one can and should be added afterwards to give a couple of examples of this evidence which is claimed not to exist. 

Of course, the real problem here is the paragraph boldly asserting """"NO EVIDENCE"""" with regard to studies in humans OR animals of brain damage.  This has been proven to be false. The paragraph also asserts that """"NO"""" mo ->"," none"

"Conferences are a problem I've been meaning to work on. There are only a very few conference series in the world for which there are truly substantial third party references, but there are many of great importance: the situation is similar to journals. In practice, tho we don't word it that way, the effective criterion for journals is that papers there are highly cited (as measured by the impact factor from  Journal Citation Reports). This can apply to conferences also. The difference is that for most conferences, the papers there are preliminary results and not rigorously peer reviewed & therefore  not highly cited as compared with journal papers by the same authors. There are two classes of exceptions: ones where the papers are major review articles in the field, and ones in engineering where they are the basic means of publication.  I'm not sure about this one. Ido not think it is  one of these exceptions, and I think the publications are mainly just abstracts, as is common with many conferences.  I would need to check, & I  cannot do it this week.  
But personally, I would include in WP articles about all journals used as references here, and all major conference series, however, I doubt this would have consensus.  The compromise solution is therefore to write the articles about the sponsoring society and have a section on the conference. That is probably the best thing to do here. 
The main thing I think we want to avoid is writing articles on individual conferences in a series. This would amount to our being a nonselective index or bibliography. '''''' ( talk ) ->"," none"

Like the CFers, I don’t think voting defines this issue, particularly when critical information has been withheld from the voters.  Let's look at tat briefly...

From the Wiki page on pseudoscience we find:

“As it is taught in certain introductory science classes, pseudoscience is any subject that appears superficially to be scientific or whose proponents state is scientific but nevertheless contravenes the testability requirement, or substantially deviates from other fundamental aspects of the scientific method.[3]”

From the Wiki page on the scientific method, we find:

“Among other facets shared by the various fields of inquiry is the conviction that the process be objective to reduce a biased interpretation of the results. Another basic expectation is to document, archive and share all data and methodology so they are available for careful scrutiny by other scientists, thereby allowing other researchers the opportunity to verify results by attempting to reproduce them. This practice, called full disclosure, also allows statistical measures of the reliability of these data to be established.”

From my comments in the “Bias on both sides” section on this page we find:

The assertion that published studies on He in ‘cold fusion’ experiments came from air leaks, that this necessitates that the CFers perform ‘full disclosure’ on their experimental results and methods, and that that has not yet been done.

and:

The assertion that heavy metals found in cold fusion experiments comes from a) contaminants or b) improper analysis of data, that this necessitates that the CFers perform ‘full disclosure’ on their experimental results and methods, and that that has not yet been done.

And from my other comments on calorimetry (incl. edits to the CF  Wiki page), we find:

The assertion that apparent excess heat arises from an analytical method problem, that the CFers exclude these concerns based on a dislike of a proposed speculative physical/chemical mechanism that might or might not be a source of a calibration constant shift problem, while ignoring the mathematical fact that a 1-3% change in cal. constants can account for the large majority of such heat claims.  One fundamental aspect of the scientific method is the concept that if two alternative explanations exist for a given set of observations, then the situation is undefined and more new work must be done designed to test each alternative and distinguish between the two, because two distinct, conflicting explanations for a phenomenon can’t both be correct.  Failure to do that substantially deviates from other fundamental aspects of the scientific method.  Failure to incorporate a viable alternative into experimental protocols produces a biased interpretation of the results.

How much more profitable for Lufthansa is to accuse yong boy instead MAIN PILOT, who may be the real suicide person with real message to Lufthansa before he die on CVR. The question is: What will Lufthansa lose if the truth is that one of its pilot commit suicide because of disagreement with the policy of the company - and at what cost Lufthansa will try to keep it secret?

The premiership came down to the last match between West Perth and Rovers (not really a grand final, as it was still part of the regular fixtures), which resulted in a draw, 4.10 (WP) to 4.7 (R) – I'm guessing behinds weren't counted at this stage. Also, I think this comment pretty much confirms it: """"Fremantle supporters will feel very sore at not having any interest in the final match for the premiership. Really they have themselves to blame for the school-boyish behavior they have shown in ignoring the Association."""" Fremantle later challenged Rovers to a premiership decider under any umpire selected except Mr. Croft, which Rovers quite rightfully declined to take part in.

 Yiannis Kotsiras deletion 

You are listed as deleting his page because of """"unambiguous copyright violations"""". However, the website you attribute the copyright to (discoogle.com) itself credits Kotsiras.gr, the artist's website.  You'll find the same biography there, though with fewer errors. (The writing demonstrates idiosyncrasies common to Greeks when they write in English, so it is unlikely it was cribbed from elsewhere.) 

If I google a musician's name, such as Bill Frisell, I will find dozens of websites with the same biography. That's because the content came from a P.R. release. I work in publishing and have never heard of anyone copyrighting such a thing.

Obviously, there is no copyright infringement.  So can we have the article back, please? This is the second time that I know of that his biography has been deleted and I imagine Kotsiras has better things to do than struggle in English with replacing it constantly.

He is the most famous singer in Greece and we deserve to know about him.  I am an inveterate user of Wikipedia and I had to go to the Greek language version to get the information.

 Verifiability 

Hi Flexme. You said...

SingKong ... this issue of quoting sources giving reliablilty of information ... it seems sensible at first ... yet it is wildly out of control ... check out the comment on the updraft page where it is said to be an expensive way to produce windpower (it might be expensive , but this is NOT the way to show it) ... this is simply a website quoting the media who quote someone's offhand comment - possibly out of context ... this is not reliable! Or another ... the floating chimney, as jdh saw it was totally misguided (though it may start a similar but sensible design in sci fi novels) Similarly, if i was to """"publish"""" my results of my analysis that is at present on my talk page and in the tower discussion page on ANY other website, even on my own yahoo freesite, then my results would suddenly become verifiable!!!!!! this is out of control. i read wikipedia a lot and find it a wonderful source of info, i had no idea about this shambles behind the scenes. when i first started editting i assumed that wikipedia itself was a nice central location to bring my ideas so they could be verified in some sense, but it seems that if you feel you know something then in fact you are best off going ANYWHERE other than wikipedia!? bizzarre!Flexme 

I understand the frustration - I had a similar reaction. But keep in mind, this is an encyclopedia written by many people, and it's the concept and practice of verifiability that stops it becoming a shambles. This can be quite frustrating for someone who knows their material without necessarily having sources at their fingertips - however, I do believe it's essential.

I met a guy in Nimbin a few months ago, who complained that he'd edited Wikipedia 4 times, and had been reverted each time. He was putting in his own ideas... but he was in a very different category to you. This guy appeared to be mentally ill and believed in all sorts of bizarre conspiracy theories. Now, if there is no test of verifiability, it can make things impossible for other editors, as it may not be obvious, from looking at the article and history page, which editor is a genius, which one has a PhD in solar power generation, and which one has been getting their ideas from conspiracy rags and voices in their head. (Not to be harsh to the mentally ill - but you see that it's a problem.) To demand a level of expertise of editors would be to drastically restrict the effectiveness of Wikipedia, and cause endless arguments about who is best qualified. Using the principle of verifiability, however, makes it much easier to maintain reliable articles.
 
I should add - verifiability doesn't mean you must have a source before adding something. However, it must be something that can be verified, and it is hoped a source will be added later, at least. I sometimes even put a  tag (citation needed) after material that I've written myself. 

If one person publishes an analysis on their website, that's not necessarily notable, but if editors judge it to be useful and suitable they could include it. As odd as this seems at first, it's better than putting one's ideas directly into Wikipedia, as the source is now very clear to any reader and is open to checking and comparison with other views. Also, being on an external site, the Wikipedia article doesn't automatically have to endorse that view, but can present it as one viewpoint, if that is appropriate.

I suppose one of the keys is that Wikipedia is not trying to be the reservoir of all human knowledge - though it may come closer than anything else to fulfilling that purpose, through extensive linking to other sites and sources. 

I've gone on much longer than I planned. Hope that makes sense - feel free to comment or ask further, on my page or on a relevant talk page (e.g. at the Wikipedia:Community Portal.  tc "" ->"," none"

"""I am not sure. If the word """"denialist"""" is new (which it is), you are unlikely to find a source calling an organization 100 or 150 years ago """"denialist"""". You might find all the characteristics of what denialism is of course. 

It depends on how you define denialism. If we define it very narrowly, we will only end up with 1 or 2 topics in the category of denialism, which clearly is wrong given the similarities of human behavior in those one or two areas with those in other subjects. 

I believe we should do what dictionaries do when they define a word: we look at prominent sources like the New York Times, the New York Review of Books, the London Times, the Economist, the Wall Street Journal, Academic  journals, scholarly writing, popular novels, etc to see how the word is used. For a new word, this determines its meaning, until a family of dictionary editors codifies this set of meanings as a family of different definitions that are published in dictionaries. Since we are not yet at the dictionary publication stage, but at the earlier pre- dictionary publication stage, we have to do more of the hard work ourselves. That is all. 

It is clearly a common word, in common usage, at least in some subject areas. One rarely hears the word """"AIDS denier"""" although that is essentially what an """"AIDS denialist"""" is (parenthetically noting that in fact an AIDS denialist is really an """"HIV denialist"""", properly speaking). And I suspect the phrase """"Holocaust denier"""" will fade from usage now that the new word """"denialist"""" seems to be gaining popularity. 

If one maintains that there are two separate groups, denialists and deniers, then why are there no AIDS deniers? Why no HIV deniers? Only denialists? Seems a bit strange, given that human behavior is not much different in all these cases; only the topic changes. The denying stays the same. 

If putting someone in a denialism category constitutes libel, then a very large number of publications worldwide have put themselves in legal jeopardy by publishing articles on AIDS denialists and other kinds of denialists. Given that these publications have full time legal staff and large legal budgets, and the people making these claims on Wikipedia are not lawyers or legal experts, this claim seems dubious at best. 

If we accept the gratuitous personal assertions of some that denialism is really a political movement that involves personal gain, then creationists, creation scientists and intelligent design promoters fall in this category. If """"denialism"""" is more like denial of the evidence, then this is less obviously true, since there is a dispute about the evidence in these cases. 

If we define """"denialism"""" as some here claim, to only mean those that know they are lying about the truth, then where does that leave the most common usage of the word in the phrase """"AIDS denialism"""" ? It obviously cannot mean """"lying knowingly"""" in this case, or probably in all cases. 

I suggest that if one requires a publication to directly make the claim that """"X is a Y"""", to put some article in a category, then we would depopulate most of the categories on Wikipedia. If Y has characteristics {Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4...Yn} from dictionary definitions or from common usage, and this common usage is well-understood and evident from publication in WP:V and WP:RS sources as defined above, and if X has most if not all of the characteristics {Y1, Y2, Y3...Yn}, then surely X can be put in the category Y. 

For example, suppose we define a new type of urban area called a """"Townlet"""", being an area with a common administration within a radius of 5 kilometers and a permanent human population of 5000-10000 people. Then one surely does not need a publication to state that """"Filllsberg is a Townlet"""" to put Filllsberg, meeting all the necessary criteria, in the category """"Townlet"""". 
 
I also vehemently deny the assertion that """"denialist"""" is a singularly negative category and so should not be used. If so, we would get rid of a large number of categories, such as """"pseudoscience"""". 

Also, as I have stated repeatedly, """"transhumanists"""" or """"secular humanists"""" or """"aetheists"""" might be viewed as denialists by some. And might feel perfectly proud to proclaim themselves as denialists of some overwhelming belief or putative evidence. 

For these reasons, I think there is nothing wrong with having a category called """"denialist"""", or """"denialism"""". The membership of this category might be controversial, depending on what we take as the definition of the word. Any particular subject might or might not be put in that category, given community consensus on the word's definition, and on the individual case by case analysis of any particular topic, subject or article.

"NR post office 

Hello - I came across your query on the discussion page for the New Rochelle Post Office. If you want the correct information you cannot rely on what Orlady has told you. She is the sole individual objecting to the use of the term 'mural' when referring to the artwork that is in the building. The building is a NRHP however not so much for the architectural significance, but for the murals inside. Specific reference to the term 'mural' can be seen in a number of sources that were provided.  These sources include very reliable documents including: United States Post Offices in New York  1858 to 1943  Thematic Resources (the National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form), The Westchester County Planning Board discussing the post office in relation to re-developing the site,further discussions,  and the New York Times article about the artist selected to paint the murals. The nomination form is the most irrefutable source validating the information (it specifically references two of the three murals when discussing the importance of post office art). Additionally, the city of New Rochelle continues with redevelopment of the area and has recently come to the decision that the significance of the building itself is minimal, with its only true attribute being the 'distinctive curved contour' of the front facade which is familiar to residents of the area and should be maintained. (Im sorry but I cant find this specific document at the moment). The continuing reverting of this information is entirely the result of Orlady who personally does not seem to care for the facts. Unfortunately it is resulting in a deficient and inaccurate article. I also should mention that blocking users as alleged puppets of a banned user seems to be the most useful means for Orlady to control the content of certain articles. She is clearly abusing the tool. The validity of her claims is questionable at best. I was blocked as a result of my contributions to this article, and was labeled a 'sock'. Considering that I am in no way connected to the banned user, I found it rather disturbing to be blocked based on 'evidence' that has absolutely no validity whatsoever.

Historically, testicle cuffs may have been used by the slave traders of Western Africa, as a means to subdue newly-captured males.

The testicle cuffs extended between the legs, and each man was connected to the next by a rope between their genitals.

"""I get what you're saying, and I was more than happy with him in the Legends section.  But when they include him in the open, they're putting forth that he's looked at as a member of the roster and a part of the show.

Basically they're saying """"Hey look, Rock's a Raw guy!""""

And techincally, he's the number 1 contender to the WWE Title, since John Cena is the champion (I know, there's no guarantee Cena's the champ at Mania, but as of now, Rocky's got a championship match on a PPV, thus he should be part of the roster for that alone).

But mainly, since he's featured in the open, that shows that WWE is pushing him as part of Raw.

And if 30 days passes w/o a Rock sighting, then he gets reactivated when he comes back.

""":::Yes, the text is deliberately a secondary source, because I and nobody else feels like going through Latin medieval texts all over Europe to find and compare some titles, when (1) all serious secondary sources claim the same thing, (2) wikipedia rules require secondary sources and for good and obvious reasons (no original research etc.). In addition, we have discussed the duke etc. issue already under the Stephen article (it is not as simple as it seems) and my points have been completely ignored by you et al., so why should I care in the first place, right? Secondly, no normal Hungarian academic source calls Pribina a chieftain, normal Hungarian academic sources (i.e. those I know) do not differ from Slovak, Czech, Austrian etc. sources for the time period at hand. Finally, I would like to see """"contemporary"""" sources for calling most of the early Arpáds, Kopány etc. princes etc. (which you do in this wikipedia) and not chieftains, lords etc.; and interestingly in these cases the word chieftain is really used also by academic sources, but you are not proposing such a change (those who know the circumstances in this wikipedia know the answer). It would be also interesting to find """"contemporary"""" sources for the founding of Rome in the mid-8th century and so on. And we could go on like this for many medieval European countries.

 Prince/Duchess of Cambridge 

Because the child is a boy and because the Duke of Cambridge's second title is the Earl of Strathearn we now know that the new baby is HRH The Earl of Strathearn, since he takes his fathers next title by courtesy, just as other heirs to British Dukes do, so the title of the article should be HRH The Earl of Strathearn, and it should also be noted in the section about his Title and Style. 31.109.139.238  
Dukes heir uses a courtesy title only if he have no title by own right. Now he is Prince george of Cambridge he don't need a courtesy title. If Prince William predesease his father, the new born will prince george the duke of Cambridge and etc.
eg:- George V 's third son was styled HRH The Prince Henry, The Duke of Gloucester, Earl of Ulster and Baron Culloden. his heirs(first Prince William then Prince Richard after his brothers death) hold Princely titles because of Kings male line grand children, as called Prince William of Gloucester and Prince Richard of Gloucester instead of Earl of Ulster. But Present Duke, prince Richards children don't have princely titls because they are kings great grand children(Only Prince of Wales elderst sons children get princely titles among kings grand children) and his son called Earl of Ulster and sons heir and elderst son called Lord Culloden.  

When the child has been born, assuming we don't know the given name immediately, should we move this article to Prince of Cambridge or Princess of Cambridge? This article may be linked on the Main page under In the news, so we should probably be prepared for that. I noticed there was already an Unnamed Prince of Cambridge and an Unnamed Princess of Cambridge redirecting to Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge#Pregnancy (I have just edited them to redirect here instead). Online 
No, that would not be right. The child will not be Prince of Cambridge or Princess of Cambridge, i.e. that will not be a substantive title like Prince of Wales or Duke of Cambridge. The child will be a prince of the United Kingdom known as Prince(ss) X of Cambridge. It would be best to just leave the article at Child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge until the child is named; the present title certainly won't become less accurate or less precise once the childis born.   

The child will be officially entitled Prince (Name) of Cambridge or Princess (Name) of Cambridge. So probably not.  (Want to have a chat?) 
Prince(ss) NN of Cambridge would be the best answer, but seeing as the child will be given a name within the first couple days anyway, there's no point moving the article only to move it again a couple days later. The Princess NN of Country came about mostly because of the Danish tradition of waiting until the baptism to name the child, so the articles were made when the children were born and then we had an article in place while we waited for the name. In other cases, ie Princess Estelle of Sweden or Princess Eleonore of Begium, the article Princess NN of Sweden/Belgium was created and then moved within a day or two to its proper location when their names were announced. But this article is already in place, so moving it, only to move it yet again a day or two later is pointless.   
Personally, I think Norman is a great name for a Prince, although Princess NN also has a certain ring to it.  
I agree with Morhange. Additionally, we might not be certain as to the child's precise style until one is used (styles have broken precedent before, remember!), so we really ought to avoid assuming something based on precedent which could soon turn out to be WRONG... BD 

The style of the boy is given as """"His Royal Highness Prince [name] of Cambridge"""" on the official webpages of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - so speculation about that can now end... (www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org/news-and-diary/the-duchess-of-cambridge-has-been-delivered-of-son)

That means that you suspend your belief temporarily and accept that someone can grow 2 feet and bench press a precinct.  Real world explainations of SCIENCE FANTASY maybe an interesting tidbit but is UNIQUELY NOT HIS POWERS."" ->"," toxic"

"""Also, you might want to read up on statistics and statistical data, because it is almost impossible to survey """"every one"""" in any given field of study.

""""Representative sample"""" has to do with finding a sample of people that best represents the population you are making a generalized statement about.

"This is not your average not-many-people-know-about biography or that like article. It shouldn't be to much to ask that you allow a few days, or even a few hours, for everyone who has this article on his watchlist to comment or, in my case, to prepare a more elaborate comment. It certainly is the only way to avoid an edit war.
