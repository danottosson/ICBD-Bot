Natural selection works on the phenotype, the outward form determined by genes (the genotype), the environment and the interaction between them. Only heritable variations in a trait will be passed on to the next generation and the frequency of favourable heritable traits will increase in subsequent generations. The underlying genetic variation in traits is the result of genetic processes, such as mutations and recombinations, and can undo the effect of natural selection if strong enough relative to the effect of natural selection. Natural selection, together with other mechanisms such as genetic drift and mutations, is an important component of evolution, a cornerstone of modern biological and medical research.\n\nThe term was introduced by Charles Darwin in 1859 in his book \"\"The Origin of Species\"\", as an analogy with a farmer choosing individuals that possess desired characteristics for his breeding stock, which Darwin called artificial selection.\n\nMaybe you find it not god, and in that case, I am curious what you think of that.  \n\nI made a lits of aspects here: User_talk:KimvdLinde\/Natural_selection#Natural_selection_aspects  \n\nDeMarco-Becket Memorial Trophy\nYou did a lot of reversions to [[ ->","completion":" none"}

{"prompt":"\"\n\n Identity of the designer \n\nThe paragraph just above the heading \"\"Origins of the term\"\" states:\n\n\"\"Intelligent design deliberately does not try to identify or name the specific agent of creation — it merely states that one (or more) must exist. Although intelligent design itself does not name the designer, the personal view of many proponents is that the designer is the Christian god.[34][22][35] Whether this was a genuine feature of the concept or just a posture taken to avoid alienating those who would separate religion from the teaching of science has been a matter of great debate between supporters and critics of intelligent design. The Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District court ruling held the latter to be the case.\"\"\n\nThe above statement contains a popular misconception about the identity of the designer. ID leaders have indeed named the designer. \n\nThe article's reference #34 above is to Dembski's 1999 Touchstone article in which he says that \"\"intelligent design is just the Logos theology of John's Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory.\"\" When Dembski said that, he was identifying, indeed defining, the designer as not only God but Jesus Christ, to which \"\"Logos\"\" refers in the Gospel of John, as Barbara Forrest points out on pp. 3-4 of her paper http:\/\/www.centerforinquiry.net\/uploads\/attachments\/intelligent-design.pdf.\n\nSee also the article's reference #142 at pp. 39-40 of \"\"Is It Science Yet? Intelligent Design Creationism and the Constitution,\"\" at  http:\/\/law.wustl.edu\/WULQ\/83-1\/p%201%20Brauer%20Forrest%20Gey%20book%20pages.pdf.  Note here also that Phillip Johnson also defines ID as requiring God when he defines it as \"\"theistic realism.\"\"\n\nSo it is clear that it is more than \"\"a personal view of many proponents\"\" that the designer is the Christian God.   \" ->","completion":" none"}

It is a misinterpretation in many cases of what is originally a communism-capitalism problem to be stated as a communism-religious group contradiction.

{"prompt":"\"\nYour recent edit at Sarahs talk page \nYou recently made a comment on Sarah777's talkpage which was quite strong in content. If this comment was not being addressed to Sarah, but to the IP contributor who preceeded you on the page, then it should have been made on the IP's talkpage. You should only address Sarah on Sarah's page. If, OTOH, you were addressing your remarks to sarah then you were way out of line. Either way I think you owe Sarah an apology. I also thing you should revert your edit and place it on the IPs talk page.   \n\nIt is quite obvious that i'm addressing it to the IP as Sarah never made a threat. It is hardly way out of line seeing as the IP was making what could be easily regarded as combative threat. Also its a talk page, but if you insist i shall remove the message to their talk page. An apology? I remember the last time i asked you for an apology.  (talk) \n\nI'm actually thinking of reverting my removal of the message as the IP's address is not static and each time they appear, their IP will be different.  (talk) \nThe IPs threat is as hollow as his\/her head. I wouldn't pay much attention to it.   \nNo need to personally attack them with the hollow comment. A threat by an Irishman (republican or loyalist) should never be taken as hollow lol.  (talk) \n\nI never made a threat , mabuska , so stop crying . GoodDay , my head is far from hollow, I have a static IP ,so how do I do it? please explain and personal remarks are not allowed please apologise .Back to mabuska. Never met a loyalist who is Irish , not once , did you ? \"\"could be easily regarded as combative threat.\"\" If I did make a threat you would have no problems reading it , even as like myself english is not your first tongue . Now there are going to be some issues over how I do bussiness on here , I understand that , and I DO NOT apologise for them .Now any questions? This is going to be fun .  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 109.78.243.56   \n\nIf you want to be a disruptive, arguementative, combative editor, go ahead. Such editors usually end up being indefinately blocked. Actually the vast majority of broadband IP's are never static as far as i'm as i'm aware, so unless you create an actual account to edit with, you will end up with a different IP every different day or week you appear unless it cycles back to one you've already used.\n\nAnyways who said i was a loyalist? Never said i was and will state quite clearly for you that i am not one. If i was i'd had no shame in declaring that i am.\n\nYou show your own lack of knowledge of Irish history anyways. What was James Craig, someone you can call a loyalist, described as at his funeral? As a proud Ulsterman and Irishman. Edward Carson himself was a proud Irishman but can also be easily classified as a loyalist. They always said the Troubles was mostly due to ignorance and prejudice - especially towards history. \n\nIf you really want to make a difference on Wikipedia and be somewhat successful at doing so the best way is to play by Wikipedias rules and not by being disruptive or coming out with childish remarks such as \"\"stop crying\"\" or implying threats.  (talk) \n\nNever called you a loyalist -where did you get that from I dont makes assumptions , asked you a question , you failed to answer - the men you mention are no longer and by definition you could not meet them Ireland is a sovereign state and that was my point even the loyalist I know are not Irish citizens which is what Irish is defined as , never implied a threat stop crying lol , Wikipedia has to obey wider rules than its own , I have no lack of knowledge , how do editors get block by not going by the rules -I havent broken any nor will I , now if you dont mind I have some work to do , now apologise to me for FALSELY saying I threatened you .\" ->","completion":" none"}

I would welcome a good-faith attempt by anyone to cast this material in a more acceptable light, as was suggested regarding the Thomas Mann article.

I've known this user for quite some time now, and can vouch for him in saying that he is not a sockpuppet of that user, who neither him nor myself have heard of before his blocking. I think that it is safe to assume that the IP that both Matthew2602 and the sockpuppeteer was dynamic, and used by multiple users. Perhaps other users were also unjustly blocked during that case; who knows.\n\nOnce upon a time, I woke up one morning in July two years ago, only to find that I was blocked from editing on the only wiki that I was active on at the time, mylegonetwork.wikia.com. That wiki had about 20 active users then, and upon some very quick investigation it seemed that I had been caught up in the autoblock of a user who was blocked for one day for some minor policy violation. Anyways, I got an admin to unblock me and went on my merry way. A few hours later, when talking with him and other users on the IRC, I found out that he lives in the southern United States. I live in Alberta, Canada. We were both using the same IP. Beyond my nice little story, I've known User:Matthew2602 for months. I know that he is a good user with only good faith intentions, and I also know that he would like to be able to edit here again.

Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. \n\nIf you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or \"\"db\"\" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.   \" ->","completion":" none"}

{"prompt":"\"\nHi RetroS1mone. Thanks for coming here to reply to Guido - it's no problem at all, especially when I'm not around. I replied to Guido above about the 3RR block. If Guido does take my advice to work on that table in his userspace, would you give him the time to marshall his arguments and listen to what he has to say? I know he does have COI with the activist organisation, but while strongly discouraged it is not forbidden to edit if you have a COI. See WP:COI and also Wikipedia:Suggestions for COI compliance. Me personally, I would prefer Guido edited chess articles and only participated on the talk pages of CFS\/ME pages (or worked on the article about CFS activism that has been suggested). Oh, and you are quite right about the forum-shopping. Guido, if you have a complaint about conduct on those articles, you will need to find another admin and not come to my talk page. I've commented on the talk pages of some of these articles with suggestions about the content, and (for me) that makes me too involved as an editor to use my admin tools in relation to those articles. RetroS1mone, speaking as an editor and not an admin, I would advise you not to say things in edit summaries like \"\"tendentious editor with strong COI POV\"\". The reason being that edit summaries are permanent records, and if you say something incorrect, you can't retract it. It is best to keep edit summaries focused on describing the content (not the editors) and then to say \"\"see talk\"\" if you want to go into more detail. That way, if you are wrong, you can retract and apologise later. For the record, I think you are mostly right here (though I would have phrased it more diplomatically), but I hope you see my point about the difference between saying something in an edit summary and saying something on a talk page.   \" ->","completion":" none"}

{"prompt":"\"\n\nAgreed.  That area of the table needs some work, and is not fully consistent on the distinction.  It came about because \"\"scheduled\"\" (which was formerly the word used in all future launches) was both clearly incorrect and also unsourced for many of the rows in the table.  \n\nWhen I looked at a bunch of the sources about a month ago (2015-02-14), for most of the far future launches, the most one could say is that they were \"\"under contract\"\"; while some of the very near term future launches (one to three ahead in the queue) were both clearly \"\"scheduled\"\" and also scheduled with the particular local and national authorities to make the near term date have some meaning.  So that is what led to my attempt to improve the article by having a three-way distinction: \n \"\"Scheduled (with range & launch license authorities)\"\"\n \"\"Scheduled\"\"\n \"\"Under contract\"\"\n\nIt appears that most of that bold edit was left, and has remained, while some parts have been modified by other editors.  I'm not tied to any particular worlds right now; I just want whatever article statement made in the table to be correct and verifiable by one of the cited sources provided in that particular row of the table.  \n\nI am happy that you brought the topic up on the Talk page.    \" ->","completion":" none"}

{"prompt":"\"\nIn my opinion, you're confusing different policies. You say that everything you write there is sourced; for the sake of the argument, I shan't dispute that (even though a very good point is raised there, regarding the difference between sourced and attributed). However, sourcing is required to comply with Wikipedia's policy on verifiability. Soapboxing, advocating and giving undue weight, on the contrary, are not permitted under Wikipedia's policy on neutrality. So, even if everything you state there is sourced, it still can't be included if it violates WP:NPOV.\nIt's not a matter of not liking what sources have to say; it's just that they are only opinions. I don't think criticism should be hidden or Amanda's guilt taken for granted. Actually, I don't even know if she did it, because, quite frankly, I never studied the case, but I'm convinced that if a Court of law convicted her, there must have been sufficient evidence to warrant that. Italy's not Soviet Russia... My point is that the article shouldn't mainly revolve around criticism of the trial or attempts at soiling Guede's reputation, by implying that he was a lone killer, as that, primarily, violates WP:BLP. Wikipedia is not there to retry Amanda. As I've said, I agree that criticism should be reported; it is notable and rather easily sourced. However, that should not be the focus of the article. \nFinally, as I wrote on the article's page, technically the trial record is publicly avalaible, but that doesn't mean that it was actually accessed or published (even in Italian, for that matters)...

{"prompt":"Conferences are a problem I've been meaning to work on. There are only a very few conference series in the world for which there are truly substantial third party references, but there are many of great importance: the situation is similar to journals. In practice, tho we don't word it that way, the effective criterion for journals is that papers there are highly cited (as measured by the impact factor from  Journal Citation Reports). This can apply to conferences also. The difference is that for most conferences, the papers there are preliminary results and not rigorously peer reviewed & therefore  not highly cited as compared with journal papers by the same authors. There are two classes of exceptions: ones where the papers are major review articles in the field, and ones in engineering where they are the basic means of publication.  I'm not sure about this one. Ido not think it is  one of these exceptions, and I think the publications are mainly just abstracts, as is common with many conferences.  I would need to check, & I  cannot do it this week.  \nBut personally, I would include in WP articles about all journals used as references here, and all major conference series, however, I doubt this would have consensus.  The compromise solution is therefore to write the articles about the sponsoring society and have a section on the conference. That is probably the best thing to do here. \nThe main thing I think we want to avoid is writing articles on individual conferences in a series.

Also, I remember adding some editing long ago, and Edith Durham, Stavro Skendi, Person, Robert Elsie were considered not \"\"NPV\"\", just because they stated things the Greek editors would not prefer to include. And Elsie and Pearson are used much more than Sakellariou, you can easily check.  \n\nDr.K, thank you for threatening me. At this point I am getting used.

Meanwhile I would strongly suggest you go on and revise the neutrality of the references provided as NPV by my Greek colleges.
