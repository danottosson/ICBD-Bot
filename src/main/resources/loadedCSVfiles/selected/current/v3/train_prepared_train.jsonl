You said that advisors are stationed in Georgia proper, so it's a Georgian mission. Well done! Xeeron, I get 2.87 million links when I google \"\"South Ossetia War\"\". That's English buddy. If only Xeeron, you read the title \"\"SECURITY COUNCIL HOLDS THIRD EMERGENCY MEETING AS SOUTH OSSETIA CONFLICT INTENSIFIES, EXPANDS TO OTHER PARTS OF GEORGIA\"\" South Ossetia Conflict (War) expands, as in already expanded, it says expands, NOT expanding, or about to expand, therefore, the UN knowingly named the war the [2008] South Ossetia War, KNOWING that it will expand. See how important reading the title, and getting the correct title is? My arguments haven't evaporated anywhere; South Ossetia is still location-based (my initial argument); it is still where over 90% of the fighting took place; it still has the most important battle (Tskhinvali); my arguments are still here buddy. And Xeeron, I have pointed to you countless times that might doesn't make right. Saying the majority says so, does NOT make it NPOV. If you would have lived in the South during the Civil Rights Movenment you'd realize that might doesn't make right, or NPOV for that matter. I've seen your majority view point and called it a farce many times. Grey Fox - I have proof for how the \"\"2008 Georgia War\"\" is biased; it is biased because it IMPLIES that South Ossetia was a De Facto part of Georgia - which as we all know is bullshit, because if a region is De Facto and De Jure part of a country - there is no war! My Russian colleagues may disagree, but Chechnya was not De Facto part of Russia in the 1990's, it was De Jure. And it was called the Second Chechen War, not the Russian War 1999-2006. So in other words Mr. Grey Fox, and the other two of you, you have FAILED to show my how 2008 South Ossetia War is NPOV, but I HAVE shown you, and cited an example of how 2008 Georgia War would be incorrect and biased. Therefore the title stays, case closed.   \n\n\" ->","completion":" none"}

Not really a controversy though is it when a court elected by over two hundred million people issues a decision, it'a court ruling, like it or not there's no controversy too that. Otherwise we should renaim the ted bundy trial, to the tend bundy controversy, since any court ruling merits this label. \n\nSince there's a section on anti trust laws and vista, it's worth noting the recent news that microsoft are going to be paying a hefty daily fine for completely ignoring the court's injuction. And this does have bearing on vista. You can't quote the m.s. pr saying we don't know what they want us to do, it's all questions, or whatever else he mentioned, without an adjunct sentence, of the head official regulating the anti trust actions quoting him too saying that our injuctions are crystal clear yet ms has ignored them for over two years now. \n\nBut of course this has no bearing if this article is supposed to be a showcase for vista.\n\nSo like i said, if some fuckers had gone into the trouble of actually discussing any of that instead of reverted every single edit in a hitleric fashion, things would be different.\n\nBut for now this stategy of being a hawk on an article I wish to keep in a certain way, and being completely uncivil and rude about it, merits from my part a roayl, fuck y's all, take your mouths off of gate's balls and then we can talk.\n \" ->","completion":" toxic"}

{"prompt":"\"\n\n Verifiability \n\nHi Flexme. You said...\n\nSingKong ... this issue of quoting sources giving reliablilty of information ... it seems sensible at first ... yet it is wildly out of control ... check out the comment on the updraft page where it is said to be an expensive way to produce windpower (it might be expensive , but this is NOT the way to show it) ... this is simply a website quoting the media who quote someone's offhand comment - possibly out of context ... this is not reliable! Or another ... the floating chimney, as jdh saw it was totally misguided (though it may start a similar but sensible design in sci fi novels) Similarly, if i was to \"\"publish\"\" my results of my analysis that is at present on my talk page and in the tower discussion page on ANY other website, even on my own yahoo freesite, then my results would suddenly become verifiable!!!!!! this is out of control. i read wikipedia a lot and find it a wonderful source of info, i had no idea about this shambles behind the scenes. when i first started editting i assumed that wikipedia itself was a nice central location to bring my ideas so they could be verified in some sense, but it seems that if you feel you know something then in fact you are best off going ANYWHERE other than wikipedia!? bizzarre!Flexme \n\nI understand the frustration - I had a similar reaction. But keep in mind, this is an encyclopedia written by many people, and it's the concept and practice of verifiability that stops it becoming a shambles. This can be quite frustrating for someone who knows their material without necessarily having sources at their fingertips - however, I do believe it's essential.\n\nI met a guy in Nimbin a few months ago, who complained that he'd edited Wikipedia 4 times, and had been reverted each time. He was putting in his own ideas... but he was in a very different category to you. This guy appeared to be mentally ill and believed in all sorts of bizarre conspiracy theories. Now, if there is no test of verifiability, it can make things impossible for other editors, as it may not be obvious, from looking at the article and history page, which editor is a genius, which one has a PhD in solar power generation, and which one has been getting their ideas from conspiracy rags and voices in their head. (Not to be harsh to the mentally ill - but you see that it's a problem.) To demand a level of expertise of editors would be to drastically restrict the effectiveness of Wikipedia, and cause endless arguments about who is best qualified. Using the principle of verifiability, however, makes it much easier to maintain reliable articles.\n \nI should add - verifiability doesn't mean you must have a source before adding something. However, it must be something that can be verified, and it is hoped a source will be added later, at least. I sometimes even put a  tag (citation needed) after material that I've written myself. \n\nIf one person publishes an analysis on their website, that's not necessarily notable, but if editors judge it to be useful and suitable they could include it. As odd as this seems at first, it's better than putting one's ideas directly into Wikipedia, as the source is now very clear to any reader and is open to checking and comparison with other views. Also, being on an external site, the Wikipedia article doesn't automatically have to endorse that view, but can present it as one viewpoint, if that is appropriate.\n\nI suppose one of the keys is that Wikipedia is not trying to be the reservoir of all human knowledge - though it may come closer than anything else to fulfilling that purpose, through extensive linking to other sites and sources. \n\nI've gone on much longer than I planned. Hope that makes sense - feel free to comment or ask further, on my page or on a relevant talk page (e.g. at the Wikipedia:Community Portal.  tc \" ->","completion":" none"}

{"prompt":"\"\n\nCitations and External Link\nI checked all the links and they work; which is good. Conversely, the 'Chronicles' definitely should not be listed as an external link. There are many other relevant links regarding the Round Table. A forum posting should not be used as something reliable. Also we should continue to discuss the state of the 'Contributing Attendees.' I checked some of the names and they had third party sources. Should they be added again since all Wikipedia needs is third party sources.   \nThanks for the check. I disagree about deleting the Chronicle website link. The 2007 THE article establishes that that discussion is notable. Yes, it is anonymous, but it is a discussion board for active academics. A truck driver would not be able to construct a useful post for that thread. And anonymity has virtues as well as vices: anonymity makes it possible to say what you really think without fear of reprisal, though at the risk that people will spread misinformation without fear of getting caught. Many of the posters in that Chronicle thread have track records in other threads that make what they say more reliable than it would otherwise bekind of like Wikipedia.\nAs for the \"\"Contributing Attendees,\"\" I am skeptical that we can create something that isn't Listcruft, but it would be a lot easier to evaluate if you proposed a specific edit with genuine third-party sources.  \n\n The CHE is not being used as a source. External links are different from sources.   \n\nWell my problem with the Chronicle for Higher Learning is that it seems to be very odd to me for some reason. I just have read the 'External Link' requirement page and the Chronicle for Higher Learning breaks several of the rules. Please read WP:EL under 'Link to Be Avoided' and the Chronicle forum\/discussion\/blog breaks all of a good amount of rules. I was drawn to the External Links because when I was attempting to fine info regarding the Table, many other links that could not be cited in the article because of Wiki guidelines, seem like they are much more revelant than the Chronicle blog for External Links. I propose adding another link and removing the Chronicle link because it does not adhere to Wiki guidelines. Academic38, your statement regarding who posts to the board can neither be confirmed or denyed because the postings are anonymous and nothing can be proven. It could be truck drivers with no idea about what they are talking about or otherwise; that is why Wiki discourages forums as reliable External Links. More discussion needed, but I am going to suggest the Chronicle be removed. It is already referred to under the THE explanation and does not need to be listed as an 'External Link.'   \n\nI read WP:EL and I don't see that it breaks any rules.

Given that by definition \"\"to steal and pass off the ideas or words of another as one’s own\"\" and using a \"\"created production without crediting the source\"\" is plagiarism or literary theft, when use is made of the word Ebonics (an original idea and word coined by Dr. Robert Williams as a synonym for BE, AAVE and other English language based appellations, this deceptive pattern of practice is ‘plagiaristic’ dishonesty or ‘literary theft’ that violates national and international laws protecting ‘intellectual property’ rights. This kind of plagiarism or stealth of ‘intellectual property’ via literary theft and the intentional perversion of the truth should not be tolerated and the authors of articles and books as well as publishers of dictionaries including Wikipedia, progating counterfeit and plagiaristic definitions of the word Ebonics must be held accountable.\n\nKifano S., Smith E.

{"prompt":"\"\nDitto on GAN. To me, the article is ready, though I still intend to make some minor edits. On another front, I think we ought to leave the dating issue where it stands, even though I disagree with Heylin's assessment of mid-July, which he guesses at based on the fact that BoB made its debut on the charts on July 30 (see Shades, p. 264). I find that ridiculous. For example, BIABH took six weeks from its official release on March 7, 1965, to reach the charts (May 8). Highway 61 got out much quicker, with a one-month lapse from its August 20 release before charting. Going back earlier, Another Side took about six weeks to chart and Freewheelin', more about than three months,  Using mid-July, then, means giving BoB  two weeks to debut, which is absurd. Of course, the whole problem centers on what is meant by \"\"release.\"\" In this case, it's being used to mean distribution, which was obviously delayed in BoB's case. However, the Billboard advertisement of June 25 gives at least three other clues to that: pressing, packaging and promotion. With those three in place, distribution couldn't have been more than a week behind if not already in motion.   \" ->","completion":" none"}

[reply to my email address asteconnathotmaildotcom, this IP address is my work's one =] thanks ]  \n\n Episode naming \n\nHi, Cyberia.  There's actually been a lot of discussion about this subject at Wikipedia:Naming conventions (television) and its talk page.  The consensus of most of the editors there is that articles should be disambiguated only when it's necessary — that is, when there's no other article by that name.  This is why, for example, Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down was moved to that location from Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down (Battlestar Galactica) — there is no other article that could be at that page.  This is in keeping with the general disambiguation guidelines at WP:D, specifically WP:D#Deciding to disambiguate, which says:\nAsk yourself: When a reader enters this term and pushes \"\"Go\"\", what article would they most likely be expecting to view as a result? (For example, when someone looks up Joker, would they find information on a comedian? On a card? On Batman's nemesis? On the hit song or album by The Steve Miller Band?) When there is no risk of confusion, do not disambiguate nor add a link to a disambiguation page.\nThe argument you give (that using parenthetical phrases consistently keeps articles consistent and makes them easier to identify) has been considered in the debate at WT:TV-NC, but most editors felt that the \"\"consistency\"\" was a misleading virtue, since preemptive disambiguation actually makes articles less consistent with the general Wikipedia naming scheme.  And the article itself should provide enough context to identify it.  The category system also unites articles on a similar topic.\n\nThe Star Trek precedent is, in my opinion, a bad one; the editors at the Star Trek WikiProject have been informed of the discussion at WT:TV-NC, and it is likely that Star Trek episode articles will also be moved soon.\n\nI admit that Resurrection Ship and Cylon resurrection ship are a slightly complicated case, but I think that since the episode is titled Resurrection Ship (with a capital \"\"S\"\") and the ship itself is at Cylon resurrection ship (with no capitals), it's sufficiently clear.  However, if you and other BSG editors feel that it's better to have Resurrection ship as a disambiguation page, with the episode at Resurrection Ship (Battlestar Galactica episode) and the ship at Cylon resurrection ship, that would be OK too. — (talk • contribs) \n\nIt's been considered.  See the extensive discussion at WT:TV-NC and its archives, especially here. Basically, the argument is that disambiguation isn't about identifying a subject unless there are two articles that might otherwise share the same name.  So it's appropriate for \"\"The Enemy Within\"\" to be disambiguated The Enemy Within (TOS episode), since there are other meanings of The Enemy Within (disambiguation).  But there's no need for Charlie X to be disambiguated, since only the TOS episode has that name. — (talk • contribs) \nJosiah means \"\"some\"\" editors.. 50% does not equate to \"\"most\"\" Josiah.  (talk contribs count\" ->","completion":" none"}

{"prompt":"\"\n\na side note on the high art of casting the ordinary trivial, into something special\nThis does not mean that what Risteski wrote on the guitar is not of value. Of course there may be interesting things there. Same with other methods, etc. But this whole topic (guitar pedagogy) seems to be one, where I can get information from anyone, even my neighbor. In other words: The body of knowledge related to guitar pedagogy is, to a great extent, not specialist knowledge with easy categorization of the sources of various ideas. Hence I detest when Risteski writes \"\"this work will introduce a new guitar teaching philosophy on the virtue of musical-aesthetical knowledge of classical guitar music\"\". What he wishes to display as something \"\"new\"\", is rather something that I could easily learn and find, while having discussions with my friends, with a glass of wine. So 'cheers' to guitar philosophy!  \n\nAt the same time, I can look at the article and see it empty. Risteski's articles can at least provide some food for thought; and that would be a reason to include them in the external links. I suggest: let's mix a cocktail of philosophical guitar pedagogical content. Add sugar to taste!   \nwriting articles for wikipedia is different than writing a \"\"term paper\"\" for school or a commentary for a newspaper or a book that you wish to have published. In all of those occaisions you as a writer are supposed to look at primary sources and material published by others, analyse them and put them togehter in ways that support your original thesis. Taking that approach to Wikipedia articles is not acceptable as it violates our no original research policy. For Wikipedia articles writers must take material and analysis that has already been published by others and create and article that reflects all current thought on the topic, giving appropriate propotion to each. \nAnd again, tagging an external link that does not meet our guidelines for external links onto the end of an article that is not in good shape is NOT an improvement to the article.

{"prompt":"\"\n\n UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! \n\n{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!\n\nIt had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.\n\nHaving returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.\n\nAs I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.\n\nThe conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.\n\nIt felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.\n\nThe intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.\n\nNo words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.\n\nI awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. ->","completion":" toxic"}

{"prompt":"\"\n\n Operation Northwords \nListing Operation Northwoods as a conspiracy theory is bias and unfounded by the very definition of Conspiracy Theory that this article gives. If a conspiracy theory is a theory involving a \"\"coordinated group\"\" which \"\"is, or was, secretly working to commit illegal or wrongful actions, including attempting to hide the existence of the group and its activities\"\" then Operation Northwoods does not fit the criteria. First of all, the CIA does not try to keep its self hidden or secret. It is a known agency and the plans of Operation Northwoods are no more a Conspiracy Theory just because they where kept secret then any of its other actions that the CIA plans or performs on a daily basses that are all kept secret from the general public. Secondly, Operation Northwoods was not a conspiracy within the CIA either. Not one CIA member kept it a secret from anyone who should have known about it. It other words the protocols and the chain of command for this plan was followed precisely as they should have been. And because of that fact, it was shot down, the architect of the plan was fired, the plan never took action and it was well documented which is why we know of the plan under the Freedom of Information Act. This is the exact opposite of a conspiracy theory.   \n\n Conspiracism \n\nThe section conspiracism says:\n\n'Conspiracy theories are often not taken seriously, because so many conspiracy theories - almost by definition - lack readily verifiable evidence. \n\nThis phrase is unnecessary to introduce conspiracism and is full of weasel words: \"\"often taken not seriously\"\" (has anybody made a statistic?) \"\"many conspiracy theories lack verifiable evidence\"\" (how many?) and it happens \"\"almost by  definition\"\"(??) what in the definition states tht the theory has to lack evidence???  \n\nIf nobody has nothing to comment about that I will delete the sentence above.  \n\nI disagree with the above sentence - and for sure it is not neutral but  guess that it meant that the conspiracy groups hides the evidents and\/or create them (vide the 9\/11 passport [I don't want to argue was it fabricated - I mentioning that accorsing to some people it was fabricated]).   \n\n Sequence of sections and bias \n\nThe way this article is set up suggests a very, very strong POV and it is not even really attempting to be neutral. First problem is the examples, for one they shouldn't be the second thing since it's mainly a partial list. This should be towards the end of the article. Also there is the descriptions:\n\nThe John F. Kennedy assassination was a plot by people in high places and not the work of lone gunman Lee Harvey Oswald. Oliver Stone's film JFK is based on this premise.\n\nWhile this is a conspiracy theory, one I think is somewhat likely, it is actually the most extreme of conspiracy theories in this regard. Other theories were that this was a mob hit or carried out by Cuba or the Soviets. The UFO conspiracy theory is also stated in the more extreme manner. Some theories are that the U.S. government conceals an alien presence because they're afraid of it causing a scare, which sounds more reasonable than, \"\"to be used for war and other ideas, mainly towards the New World order.\"\"\n\nAlso the fourth section is almost completely dedicated to explaining conspiracy theories in a discrediting manner, treating them like psychological abnormalities or attempts by confused individuals to make sense of a nonsensical world. It seems to be the most common and most annoying criticism of conspiracy theories. This section also is half of the actual article, with the rest mainly being an explanation of the terminology and even mentions of fictional conspiracies. Very little of this article goes to treating conspiracy theories as a justifiable practice in critical thinking that like all legitimate studies can lead to rather ridiculous theories. For instance, there are legitimate questions about 9-11, such as the $100,000 given to Atta by a head of the ISI. There are also allegations that the 9-11 Commission due to its structure and the associations of its head with the Administration was unable to do a thorough and independent investigation, with it ultimately being little more than a coverup. In every case critical thinking demands some form of explanation or theory for such facts. For instance one is that the Administration is trying to cover up connections between Pakistan and\/or Saudi Arabia and 9-11. This w ->","completion":" none"}

However, if the birthdate is correct in IMDB, she had her 111th birthday, not 121st.(  )\n\nOldest people in the world graph\nI see that Jughead has added a pretty nifty graph which represents all known oldest people at a given time from 1830 to the present date. But I can see a few problems right off the top - for one, the chart should start from 1955 which is really where the record starts in any substantive manner, as that is when the record started to be kept and subsequently amended back to. While we may be able to compile a list of oldest people going back into the 19th century, besides the fact that patchy birth records make such a compilation somewhat meaningless, any compilation beyond what already exists on this page would be original research. \n\nSecondly, it is hard to really understand what the graph represents, with a lot of tiny dots. Close clusters of dots really represent  the fact that record-holders held the title briefly, a low cluster means someone held the record for a long time. Which was only really true after 1955. The chart implies that Betsy Baker who is represented by the dot circa 1955 held the record for a whopping 25 years, which is obviously not so. And thirdly, the current record-holder just turned 115, yet is shown as being 116.\n\nMy suggestion would be to keep the vertical axis as is, but to create a bar graph for individual years of BIRTH starting with the first record-holder Betsy Baker's birth year, 1842, draw a bar for the maximum age attained for any person born in that year and do the same for each year up to 1892, the most recent birth year for which no people are proven still alive. And this would not be original research, as there is a page with this list: . There is someone for each year save 1845 there.   \nHello. Thanks for pointing out those mistakes, Jack. I'll try to improve the graph soon. Fell free to offer any more suggestions. ->","completion":" none"}

{"prompt":"\"\n\nI'm currently interested in just the principles involved in the radio signal scenario... and what conclusions inductive reasoning leads to.\n\nI don't think it would be proper inductive reasoning to see a PNRS is caused by some intelligence, another PNRS is caused by intelligence, and to induce that the third PNRS is probably caused by some intelligence. There are unknown possible ways to generate a PNRS, and they cannot be ruled out simply because experience shows a couple other examples. This feels like the political approach to space shuttle launches about 10 years ago. Back in the day, designers speced the space shuttle to be safe for launch within a certain range of temperatures. Florida has uncooperative weather and often goes outside the safe range. Politicians wanted the shuttle to launch because it's good for elections. So, they pressure the upper management of NASA to launch outside the designed safe range. This happened a number of time without problem. At some point, management decided that the designers were wrong, and that a couple of launches outside their declared safe range meant that the real safe range was much wider. This continued for a few more launches until a space shuttle exploded on launch because it was too cold. If you shuffle a deck and pull 3 or 4 face cards in a row from the top of the deck, you can't really make any sort of probability measure as to what the next card will be. it could be a deck of only face cards. It could be many full decks. it could be a stacked deck. probabilities can't be determined off of a few rolls of the dice. two cases showing the PNRS was from an alien planet is not enough to make any sort of real probability estimate on the third PNRS. This is playing on a \"\"gut feeling\"\" that people have when they're playing roulette. casino's will post the last 20 rolls. Some gamblers will see these numbers and look for some sort of \"\"pattern\"\" and bet based off of that, on the \"\"gut feeling\"\" that the roullette wheel has some bias. They may even win a few times. But the casino is better off if the wheel is truly random, so any \"\"patterns\"\" is purely coincidental.  \" ->","completion":" none"}

A 2010 roster (not a word that should be used on an article about a UK subject, but that is a different matter) is not something that exists in 2009, and even as a speculative list, it is so incomplete as to be meaningless; it also does not use the cycling squad template which is standard for team articles, but these are not the point.  Returning to the Crystal balling issue, you say yourself that the chance of them not riding is very slim: you thus acknowledge that this is a possibility, and therefore their inclusion in the squad is not a definite fact.  Let's hope it doesn't happen, but Sky might go bust, or any one of the signed riders might have a career ending injury, before 1 January, in which case 2010 will arrive, they will not be part of the team, and the encyclopaedia will be guilty of having recorded an error.  Facts, not expectation.    \n\nI will happily accept that the signing of a contract to ride for the team in 2010 doesn't mean that any of these will actually ride for the team in 2010 and that the team might not even exist. However, all these riders have been signed up to ride for the team in 2010, that makes them part of the squad for 2010. We're not simply expecting them to be, they are confirmed to be. Surely though, we would be speculating if we were to disregard that and suggest it might not happen. I think you are misinterpreting WP:CRYSTAL. I'd suggest that it makes it clear that it is perfectly acceptable to include details of future events providing the information is verifiable, as is the case here. If it turns out that any or all of these riders don't ride for Team Sky in 2010 then the Wikipedia article won't have been \"\"guilty of having recorded an error\"\" because it was an entirely accurate description of the situation at this time based upon the information available.   \n\nI'm not saying that it won't happen, nor that it is not very likely, but that it is expectation, not fact.  You speak of verifiability, but life teaches us that the future is not verifiable.  If they were to die before the end of this year, they will not be in the 2010 team: the future is not confirmed.  An \"\"entirely accurate description\"\" of something that does not currently exist is not possible (and as a description, a 6 man top level racing squad is not entirely accurate).   \n\nI find your position on this matter a little strange. You seem to want to defend the article from speculation but in doing so, seem to be introducing your own speculation that the team might not exist or the riders might change. The names that are being announced are for the 2010 squad, so it seems perfectly appropriate to describe the list as such. We can, and should, only base the article on what can be verified at the current time, and that is that the riders named are part of the team for 2010. The information we have at the current time says these individuals are confirmed to ride for the team in 2010 and our article is, and should, only ever be based upon information available at the time. I would note that, not only has another user reverted the change you made which I am concerned about here, but also that a further ten names have been announced ->","completion":" none"}

{"prompt":"\"\n\n Star City \n\nI guess the reason I've been encountering you a lot lately is because I started editing articles to do with Russia (via the Soviet space program), and you seem to be the top contributor at WikiProject Russia. By the way, have you read Sue's recent message? \n\nI'm not sure what the big deal with Star City is, and why it's causing such big discussions.. but I think it might be related to the Korolev \/ Korolyov issue we're also discussing. That is, I believe there should be a preference to use usual English names, while you appear to have a preference for the default romanization. It seems to me, that \"\"Star City\"\" is the English name for this region - whether incorporated or not. Notice on other language Wikipedias, including the Russian Wikipedia, they don't have two articles on the area.. after all, the Russian names are the same. Maybe there's a dispute here on English Wikipedia because the English name (the one originally used by NASA) is different from the default transliteration (just like Korolev \/ Korolyov).  \n\nBasically, I think the definition of \"\"conventional English name\"\" in WP:RUS isn't quite compatible with the usage in WP:COMMONNAME. In particular, WP:COMMONNAME doesn't require the sources to be \"\"dictionaries\"\". But WP:RUS does require the sources to be dictionaries, and I believe this difference is causing problems. WP:RUS is not a key Policy or Guideline (maybe it's more like a WikiProject advice page, that achieved wide support in 2007); as such it should elaborate on the key policies, not change them. I think the \"\"dictionary\"\" requirement should be reworded, to allow for situations where the place name doesn't occur in a dictionary, but can still has a conventional English name.\n\nI'm generally not a fan of lengthy discussions over relatively insignificant issues, like the organization of \"\"Star City\"\" articles, or what Korolyov (city) is named (I don't actually care very much). One of the reasons I've engaged in discussions with you, is because you are an experienced editor, who apparently oversees a huge number of Russian-related articles. I'd like to change your mind regarding WP:RUS - that we shouldn't be insisting on \"\"dictionaries\"\".   \" ->","completion":" none"}

Let me counter this with a short quote from the Preface to Robert Remini's biography on Joseph Smith:\n\"\"I should make it clear at the outset that I am not a Mormon. As such I faced several problems in writing this book, one of which involved Joseph's visions and revelations, which are crucial to an understanding of him, his Church, and the times in which he lived. After considerable thought I decided to present his religious experiences just as he described them in his writings and let readers decide for themselves to what extent they would give credence to them. I am not out to prove or disprove any of his claims. As a historian I have tried to be as objective as possible in narrating his life and work.\"\" (Remini p. x)\nIn his book, Remini presents the First Vision as Smith said it happened, the same as other biographers do, and the same way I believe we should do. Like Remini, we should not be trying to prove or disprove any of Smith's claims, but unlike Remini, or job is fairly simple. We don't have to worry about what was historical and what was not.

The premiership came down to the last match between West Perth and Rovers (not really a grand final, as it was still part of the regular fixtures), which resulted in a draw, 4.10 (WP) to 4.7 (R) – I'm guessing behinds weren't counted at this stage.

{"prompt":". The obvious mistake in the inadequate use of “prosecute” in the translation of the French Rabbinate can be analysed as an unconscious confession and denunciation of the falsification committed by the rabbinical ancestors.\n\nTABFor when he dictates his Commandments, the Eternal does not play with double meanings. Then here on the Sinai, the historical context is that of abandonment of circumcision until Gilgal. Therefore, only the bad faith of the fanatic victims of circumcision could twist the text in a misinterpretation that nobody should ever have imagined. For in order to restore circumcision, the rabbis were compelled to conceal the veritable meaning of the Second Com-mandment through falsifying the sense of the most sacred text of the Torah since directly written by God. The manipulation of the faithful is obvious. The sole attenuating circumstance would be pathological denial of the reality of the meaning of the Second Commandment, due to blind faith in Abraham’s commandment and to the deep psychological trauma its implementation provokes. It is indeed high time to put an end to it.\n\nTABBesides, it is possible to word a hypothesis about the two versions of the Second Commandment, that which forbids circumcision and that which does not mention it. Until today, the authenticity of the Book of Deuteronomy has been considered warranted by the fact that the manuscript was found again buried in the temple of Jerusalem at the return from the exile in Babylon. But it is impossible that God should have varied in his formulation of the Ten Commandments; the Levite rabbis varied, not God. The redaction of the book of Deuteronomy has certainly been altered, truncated from the ban of circumcision. One must think that the discovery in the temple was a whole performance intended to warrant the return to circumcision. For the rabbis only knew the book of Deuteronomy, a book of rules of boring reading whilst the book of the Exodus was well-known to the people; it was the source of religious education and it was impossible to falsify it, only its interpretation could be changed. The version of the Book of the Exodus is both the authentic version and the one written at the intention of Nebuchadnezzar. Indeed, at the time of captivity, those who obeyed the divine will to respect the human body were likely still numerous. The Jews were divided about this point and the version of the Exodus enabled the rabbis to explain the fact to Nebuchadnezzar, while distinguishing the Jews from the Egyptians in order to avoid slaughter. The version of the Book of Deuteronomy was made up at the return from exile in order to warrant the new orthodox interpretation of the Second commandment of the Book of the Exodus.\n\nTABAbolishing the commandment of Abraham, the Second Commandment makes the right to physical integrity the first of the rights of man. One can even think that in the Third Commandment that comes right after this condemnation of circumcision:\n\n“You will not invoke the name of the Eternal your God to support lie...” (20: 7, French Rabbinate),\n\nMoses reproaches Abraham for having perjured saying that God would have ascribed him circumcision. A shrewd reader of the Bible, Mohammed took up this accusation in verses 4: 118-119 of the Koran (see below). For if God ever ordered Abraham circumcision, he forbade Moses to do it. Either it was not the same God or he changed his mind between both Alliances, or still Abraham lied and no God ever ordered circumcision. The Book of the Deuteronomy confirms that God did not impose circumcision to Moses ->","completion":" none"}

{"prompt":"\"\n\nHi. The issue here is very simple.  The article currently states there is \"\"NO\"\" evidence that ECT causes brain damage in humans or animals.  The article also states that there are \"\"NO\"\" recent reviews that found such evidence.  Both of these claims in the article have been proven to be grossly incorrect. Yet a paragraph is devoted to it.  Because such fallacious claims are made often however, a paragraph was written pointing out an example of a mouse study pointing to the contrary, and also cited a new study that found that ECT compromises normal cerbral blood flow in humans, possible evidence pointing to brain dysfunction.  The information is sound, supported, and appropriate given the subheading and the preceding paragraph that promotes gross misstatements of fact by saying that there is \"\"NO\"\" evidence of brain damage in humans or animals, and \"\"NO\"\" modern reviews pointing to such evidence. (And yes, there are reviews, as has been proven.)   \n\nThe progression of arguments to the contrary here is quite odd and revealing:\n\n1) First the paragraph was too long and was trimmed down and a study removed.\n2) Then there's an argument that the two studies don't directly relate to one another and shouldn't therefore be in the same paragraph, even though it's abundantly obvious why they are (to contradict previous paragraph finding \"\"NO\"\" evidence in humans or animals, and provide an example of study finding brain damage in mice, and an example study finding compromised, abnormal cerebral blood flow in humans)\n3) Then an argument that this mouse study should only be a minor footnote that no one will read (even though the reason it's there is to provide an example that yes, there IS evidence)\n4) Then an attack is made on the design of the study, apparently suggesting that it isn't evidence because of the mouse strain chosen. (which I disagree with, and regardless it's not a wiki editor's place to challenge the mouse strain choice of expert neuroscientists who make this stuff their life's work  it's their study. Moreover, it isn't the superiority of the study that got it here, it was listed as an \"\"example\"\" that YES THERE IS EVIDENCE IN ANIMAL MODELS OF BRAIN DAMAGE).\n5) Then the claim is made that the mouse study struggles to support the paragraph.\n6) Then the mouse study is called trivial until it's replicated (even though again it was added as an \"\"example\"\" that YES, there is evidence, not because of overriding importance)\n7) Then I pointed out in the talk page that one of the \"\"NO\"\" evidence claims made in the preceding paragraph in the article is that there are no modern reviews finding evidence of brain damage. I proved this claim to be false, and cited to Peter Breggin, a very well-known MD who has written a book on the topic and a recent comprehensive review of the literature citing close to 200 references and finding numerous evidence of brain damage in animals.\n8) Then Breggin is personally attacked, apparently suggesting that his published review isn't good enough to disprove the \"\"no evidence in recent reviews\"\" claim, because he's not a \"\"reliable source.\"\" (I also point out that there are other reviews finding evidence, including one done in the Russian mouse study).\n9) Then in response to me writing that there there either IS evidence of brain damage in animals or humans or there is not, and that a single study stating that brain damage was found in a modern study can defeat the harsh claim of \"\"NO\"\" evidence of brain damage in animals, it's argued that \"\"that's not the way that science works\"\", and \"\"several studies also can mean squat\"\". \n10) Then it's argued I can't negate \"\"secondary\"\" sources that found no evidence of brain damage in animals or humans with direct \"\"primary\"\" sources of published experimental studies which found such damage as part of their experiment. (This is not to mention that there are also other published reviews finding evidence of brain damage in others' work).\n11) etc.\n\nIn addition to this, it's claimed that this single paragraph briefly showing a couple studies pointing to possible adverse effects (the subheading IS Adverse Effects, btw), violates the Wikipedia policy of undue weight.  This is incredibly strange as the paragraph immediately before the new paragraph is entirely devoted to multiple claims of \"\"No evidence\"\" of braind damge in humans OR animals.  If a paragraph can be devoted to \"\"No evidence\"\" stating untruths, then one can and should be added afterwards to give a couple of examples of this evidence which is claimed not to exist. \n\nOf course, the real problem here is the paragraph boldly asserting \"\"NO EVIDENCE\"\" with regard to studies in humans OR animals of brain damage.  This has been proven to be false. The paragraph also asserts that \"\"NO\"\" mo ->","completion":" none"}

HELP!  Thanks  Dr. Matt Hogendobler     User:PresidentistVB  \n\nP. S. He's bragging about it in the Admin noticeboards group.  Fortunately for him, there's another admin with some sense to share with him.  This is perfect data!  But I am still in jail and I don't dare call Sue on a Sunday.\n\n He cannot; he's been blocked (by me) for a whole whackload of reasons that are painfully obvious to all  the panda  ₯’ \n\n ...and he's removed his block notice.  I'll let someone else take care of that  the panda  ₯’ \n\n Er, lest there be any confusion or misunderstanding, blocked users are free to remove block notices from their own talk pages.  There is no requirement that they wear a scarlet letter for the duration of their block, so for the moment there is nothing to \"\"take care of\"\".  Encouraging someone else to go to his talk page and replace the block notice is just poking the bear.  (And it's pretty obvious that this particular editor is already more than sufficiently wound up....)\nA problem only arises if a blocked editor removes notices related to his or her block and then requests unblocking—the concern in such a situation is that an editor may be attempting to conceal or mislead regarding the reasons for their block.

{"prompt":"OK, So HBO is a joke to you. Burt Sugar, Dan Rapeal and ESPN are a joke to you. Roy Jones was a paper champion to you but this bum Zsolt Erdei is the legitimate champion? The guy who's never fought, let alone beat a decent fighter besides Gonzales, who Jones totally shut out. That makes allot of sense. Regardless. Bernard Hopkins won a light heavyweight title and that's the bottom line. He was the first Middleweight in history to jump to the light heavyweight division and win A title in 1 fight. Something Ray Robinson failed to do. That's a fact and should be included in this biography. Erdei and the lineal title is a JOKE. What good is the stupid title if none of these guys have to defend it against decent competition? You can't hide behind a lame WBO title fighting nobodies and tomato cans and expect to be considered champion. Erdei is a disgrace and so was Michalczewski. That's why Jones embarrassed the guy who beat him. ->","completion":" none"}

And by the way, the book from Elizabeth Marshall Thomas was translated from english into german, and I provided the original title, which you obviously failed to notice. You are the one who makes dubius claims and what are these claims based on? And if a source is not good enough for you because it's written in german, than you should also get rid of for instances the italian sources in the article on the italian wolf. And the dingo is a domestic dog? Here is again the whole not researching topic. You say it is not a domestic dog because it's classified as a different subspecies? What is that classification based on? And in fact, that seems not to be the name with the widest use, that's probably still canis familiaris dingo. And some even use the name canis lupus familiaris dingo or Canis lupus forma familiaris dingo, google them if you think you can get yourself to do that. Check the books of Helmut Hemmer if you don't believe that the dingo shows the same features which are regarded as being caused by domestication and which are also present in other domestic dogs.

{"prompt":"Sorry that you're getting frustrated. In general, reversion of blanked pages is a well-established practice. In addition, removal of comments from one's own talk page, especially negative comments, is viewed as somewhat sneaky and will usually be reverted. Talk pages are a way for users to see what the community thinks of a certain user and they way they interact. For this reason, archiving it on a remote page won't work. However, you may consider archiving it yourself to a subpage, provided you link the subpage from here. I'm not sure what kind of procedure you would like me to go through before reversion; as I said, it is common practice to revert blanked pages. I understand that you want the restoration to stop but understand that the community in general does not agree with you, and when you are fighting the community it is bound to be frustrating. Also please note that I am not an administrator. Finally, if those comments do not apply to you, or you wish to move on, I suggest registering and obtaining your own user name (it's free and no e-mail address is required).

{"prompt":"\"\n\n Prince\/Duchess of Cambridge \n\nBecause the child is a boy and because the Duke of Cambridge's second title is the Earl of Strathearn we now know that the new baby is HRH The Earl of Strathearn, since he takes his fathers next title by courtesy, just as other heirs to British Dukes do, so the title of the article should be HRH The Earl of Strathearn, and it should also be noted in the section about his Title and Style. 31.109.139.238  \nDukes heir uses a courtesy title only if he have no title by own right. Now he is Prince george of Cambridge he don't need a courtesy title. If Prince William predesease his father, the new born will prince george the duke of Cambridge and etc.\neg:- George V 's third son was styled HRH The Prince Henry, The Duke of Gloucester, Earl of Ulster and Baron Culloden. his heirs(first Prince William then Prince Richard after his brothers death) hold Princely titles because of Kings male line grand children, as called Prince William of Gloucester and Prince Richard of Gloucester instead of Earl of Ulster. But Present Duke, prince Richards children don't have princely titls because they are kings great grand children(Only Prince of Wales elderst sons children get princely titles among kings grand children) and his son called Earl of Ulster and sons heir and elderst son called Lord Culloden.  \n\nWhen the child has been born, assuming we don't know the given name immediately, should we move this article to Prince of Cambridge or Princess of Cambridge? This article may be linked on the Main page under In the news, so we should probably be prepared for that. I noticed there was already an Unnamed Prince of Cambridge and an Unnamed Princess of Cambridge redirecting to Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge#Pregnancy (I have just edited them to redirect here instead). Online \nNo, that would not be right. The child will not be Prince of Cambridge or Princess of Cambridge, i.e. that will not be a substantive title like Prince of Wales or Duke of Cambridge. The child will be a prince of the United Kingdom known as Prince(ss) X of Cambridge. It would be best to just leave the article at Child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge until the child is named; the present title certainly won't become less accurate or less precise once the childis born.   \n\nThe child will be officially entitled Prince (Name) of Cambridge or Princess (Name) of Cambridge. So probably not.  (Want to have a chat?) \nPrince(ss) NN of Cambridge would be the best answer, but seeing as the child will be given a name within the first couple days anyway, there's no point moving the article only to move it again a couple days later. The Princess NN of Country came about mostly because of the Danish tradition of waiting until the baptism to name the child, so the articles were made when the children were born and then we had an article in place while we waited for the name. In other cases, ie Princess Estelle of Sweden or Princess Eleonore of Begium, the article Princess NN of Sweden\/Belgium was created and then moved within a day or two to its proper location when their names were announced. But this article is already in place, so moving it, only to move it yet again a day or two later is pointless.   \nPersonally, I think Norman is a great name for a Prince, although Princess NN also has a certain ring to it.  \nI agree with Morhange.

He does not suggest going for GA but that is still an option.\n He thinks the UN references look reliable - but not sure if this is a comment on npov too.\n Perhaps we need additional comment on the subject area, npov and other aspects of the article as well as WP:MOS etc.\n  \nSustainability\nPrevious peer review\n\n A script has been used to generate a semi- review of the article for issues relating to grammar and house style; it can be found on the automated peer review page for July 2009.

{"prompt":"I am always skeptical about these 'naked spacewalks' for various reasons. They say our body is ~70% water, but that does not really paint an accurate picture. The reality is that we are more like soda pop in a bottle, where we have a certain amount of nitrogen, oxygen, and other trace gasses dissolved in our bloodstream at STP. The key here is the STP part. As with a bottle of soda, when the pressure is decreased, the gasses rapidly come out of solution, which is what produces the fizz. Similarly, if your body went rapidly from STP to the vacuum of outer space, you would almost certainly experience a similar effect. To be blunt, your blood would quite literally boil and you would surly die of an aneurysm or internal bleeding from all the vessels which would be breached by the gasses trying to escape. About the closest I've seen to this being accurately portrayed is in the film Event Horizon, where it shows all the vessels on Justin's body becoming visible as they rapidly expand when the airlock pressure is decreased. But still, it does not explain where the gas goes, which is the same problem in this film. It seems wholly impossible to survive such a drastic change in atmospheric pressure. ->","completion":" none"}

The famine would be one such reason, but as that is over there is now nothing stopping them. It is not a demand to go home, merely a mocking suggestion.

Although the codes granted certain basic civil rights to blacks (the right to marry, to own personal property, and to sue in court), they also provided for the segregation of public facilities and placed severe restrictions on the freedman's status as a free laborer, his right to own real estate, and his right to testify in court. Although some Northern states had black codes before the Civil War, this did not prevent many northerners from interpreting the codes as an attempt by the South to reenslave blacks. The Freedmen's Bureau prevented enforcement of the codes, which were later repealed by the radical Republican state governments. ->","completion":" none"}

{"prompt":"Mathematicians hired to monitor transactions \n\nI removed the following part of the article:\n\n Business.dk reported that the bank has a team of mathematicians employed to surveil the clients' trading patterns.\n\nSaxo Bank is not doing anything untraditional in employing mathematicians, since indeed most larger financial institutions employ a number of mathematicians, economists and even physicists. To a lay reader this may sound incriminating or disturbing, but the main task of these employees is in fact to improve the trading systems performance in relation to speed and pricing, and safety in relation to sniping and other unauthorized activity. \n\nFurthermore, the secret source in the business.dk article referenced claims that Saxo employs these mathematicians to monitor individual trading patterns (in order to take unfair advantage of customers). However, and this is not stated in the business.dk article: Saxo shows the same two-sided price, for the same amount, at the same time, to any and all clients trading. This means that no single clients trading pattern is of interest. \n\nTherefore the accusation in the business.dk article is not only wrong, but also shows the lack of insight from the secret source and the journalist who wrote it. The fact that an article was brought in an online newspaper does not excuse wrong information. In relation to this particular statement regarding the role of the employed mathematicians, therefore, the article is in my opinion an unreliable source, in accordance with the Wikipedia principles of WP:IRS\n\nEither this information regarding the widespread use of mathematicians among larger financial institutions, and regarding Saxo showing the two-sided price etc. should be included, (which I originally did until it was removed) to clarify to the lay reader that this is not uncommon or suspicious, and correct the mistaken information in the business.dk article, or the information about employing mathematicians should be left out completely, to preserve the neutrality of the article. ->","completion":" none"}

{"prompt":"\"Carl_Paladino&diff;=388097440&oldid;=388080941 October 1], and again on October 2. On Linda McMahon, you have a long history of editing and edit warring on the page, and probably would have been blocked if Malinaccier hadn't protected the page on September 17; your October 1 and October 2 edits are inadvisable due to your history on that page, but I'm not really concerned with those since the things you reverted are borderline vandalism. Therefore the main motivation for the current block was your final edit to Carl Paladino.    ♦ ♣ ♠ \nI'm not sure I buy two reverts in two days as disruptive edit warring. Moreover, the combination of low speed and non-explicit warnings are concerning. Certainly, the articles in question attract people writing for differing political agendas, but I'm not aware of any specific sanctions\/enforcement which apply to these articles at the moment.   \nSir - my \"\"history of edit warring\"\" was basically two years ago.  20 total edits on a page [Linda McMahon]] which another editor has over 800 edits does not seem to me to show anything near an edit war.  So I am surprised to see your rationale is the Carl Paladino page!   is a legitimate edit, and not actionable at all.  is also proper, and a day earlier.  I have a grand total of 28 edits on that page, or an average or just over an edit a day also removing clear vandalism as well).  But you blocked me without any indication of my crime, and were absent for quite a while - leaving me in limbo.  Frankly, 72 hours for a person who has no recent edit war problems seems extreme.   And for this use of block as punishment - I have doubts as to propriety thereof.  Did you block because Ohiostandard kept asserting that I was edit warring?  AFAICT, he never even posted a single diff for his charge. Thank you - now can I be unblocked so I can resume normal editing?  My radiation treatment limits my activities quite a bit.  Oh - look at this sort of \"\"editor\"\" I have had to face at ,  and a favorite example to show the kind of edits I reverted on the article.    \nThis looks like a bad block, and even worse when I read the explaination from the admin. Is there any \"\"history\/involvement\"\" per say with the blocking admin?   \nWRT asserting that Ohiostandard 'warned me\"\" - he never edited on the Paladino article, nor mentioned it to me. Right now the block is clearly punitive, and I respectfully request it be removed with a note that it was not \"\"edit war\"\" on my part. I do not see the point in having a clear record for nearly two years - and then being blocked for a 1RR because someone \"\"thinks\"\" I must be watched! The only connection I have with Ohiostandard is that he did not like my post about Screwball23.   \nExamples of current edits from others  .  And of course the current content of \"\" Content of the emails in question includes video of dancing African tribesmen under the title \"\"Obama Inauguration Rehearsal\"\", a video titled \"\"Miss France 2008 Fucking\"\", an altered image of President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama dressed as a pimp and a prostitute, an image of a cargo plane landing in an African desert behind a group of panicked men titled \"\"Run, Niggers, Run!\"\" and a video portraying a woman engaged in copulation with a horse.

{"prompt":"﻿Sensual Pleasures of the MindItalic text\n\nThere are endless creative ways to provoke and capture sensual feelings. Money can’t buy it, you can’t see it or hold it, outer\npackaging offers no competition for it and no grandiose flash of materialistic presence can incite it. Sensuality in it’s truest sense can only be felt within.  It is provoked by and through the power and brilliance of the mind. It is born there and lives there.\n\nSince it is a feeling rather than a physical event, it is more difficult to achieve and maintain than might be found with other less deeply rooted sexual experiences.  Knowledge, intuition and creativity are the tools necessary to discover where it lives and how to awaken it, what it takes to stimulate it and how to nurture it so it will grow. A conscientious partner can create a need and cravings simply by using the power of the mind.    \n\nAll of this offers new meaning to the old adage about the mind being a terrible thing to waste. There are hot spots in the psyche that can be triggered by suggestion and connection. (Emotional Buttons)  Pushing those buttons engenders our partner's sensory and sexual experience. We do this by using one type of energy to spark another and by channeling emotional reactions into sexuality. Where the adventure leads is limited only by the knowledge, intuition and creativity an individual possesses. Nothing is written in stone and there is no list of how to’s.  It’s freelance flight.\n\nKnowledge is power! Getting to know your partner and what makes her\/him tick and tingle is the first step. The ability to\nunearth these secret treasures comes from paying close attention to things you say or do that result in an action or reaction\nindicating you have your finger on a button (hot spot). Finding all of those buttons, exploring the endless possibilities and\ndiscovering the wondrous places they lead, takes patience and thought, but the rewards are immeasurable.\n\nHaving well honed intuition is a valuable asset. Liken it, if you will, to a good quarter back with a natural talent for reading the defense. If you ‘know’ what your partner needs, wants and desires without her\/him having to explain it all, then you hold a powerful advantage. Possessing a good base knowledge of the opposite sex, in general, offers a continual win, win proposition\n\nBeing gifted with a creative imagination or obtaining skills in this arena will offer many positives for a lasting and pleasurable sex life. Desires and cravings are born in the mind and live there so it would make sense to use the power of the mind to it fullest to gain the greatest results. Spice and adventure are two major factors in all sexual experiences. If they are not on the top of your list of priorities then they should be. Avoiding boredom is key in creating cravings for more. If it wasn't good the first time, why would anyone want to repeat it?  Taking your partner to a place where she\/he has never been before and making each experience a lasting memory should be primary goals. That is the stuff heroes are made of.\n\nSexual stimulation can be achieved and sustained through physical manipulation, sexual pleasures, or through mind play and manipulation A physical presence, a verbal exchange, a mere mental\/emotional connection or any combination of all of the above can create an ‘altered mental state’, a place of arousal and euphoria.\n\nSensual\/erotic tasks and journals are great avenues to maintain altered states. Rituals and sensual tasks , while away from your\npartner can help keep the buttons pushed, the bond strong, keep the connection flowing and offer sexual stimulation on an\nongoing basis. Keeping your partner in an ‘altered state’ often and for as long as possible will help in creating cravings and lead to a path ultimate sexual pleasure.\n\nAltered states....\n1-Sexuality.....intensely 'turned on' riding a sexual high ...erotica.....consumed by passion\n2-Endorphin high...... an altered state resulting from physical or intense mental stimulation.\n3-Euphoria.....totally absorbed in your partner and the sensations and feelings being created.\n5-Head space......spellbound\/entranced..lost in the release of control..total freedom and flight..to be absorbed in the trust and acceptance..a peaceful place\n6-Nirvana......meditative state.....heightened consciousness with loss of awareness.....having a sense of self through 'losing oneself'......total freedom through total loss of control.\n\nAll sexual experiences need to be consensual and remain safe. ->","completion":" none"}

{"prompt":"\"\n\n Joseph McCabe criticisms - lack of NPOV \n\nI previously added criticism to this section from Joseph McCabe, drawing from his writings in \"\"History's Greatest Liars\"\". This was dismissed as being a fringe viewpoint. This I disagree with. I'd first note the lack of criticism of St. Francis and Franciscans, demonstrating a lack of NPOV (something commented on by others), and also a conflict of interest in Marauder40 deleting these comments, where he seems to act with a conflict of interest, being a devoted Catholic and member of a Secular Franciscan order, as noted in his bio. I do not see him as someone to act with impartiality in considering criticisms of Franciscans.\n\nI now look at whether Joseph McCabe's views can be considered as \"\"Fringe\"\" Joseph McCabe has an entry in Wikipedia, n.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Joseph_mccabe , and was himself a Franciscan Monk till the age of 19.

He also draws upon the writings of Father Hoetzappel, a historian of the Franciscan order, not to mention his own pertinent background and experiences.\n\nIn this light, I consider the comment I introduced earlier as appropriate to Wikipedia, providing a range of views and importantly, criticism from a recognised scholar.

He was then sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). There, Orton became OVW Hardcore Champion on two separate occasions.[8]\n\nAfter signing with WWE, Orton became a member of the stable Evolution, which quickly led to him capturing his first title with the company.[9] Orton also acquired the moniker \"\"Legend Killer\"\" during a storyline where he began disrespecting Hall of Famers and physically attacking veterans of professional wrestling outside of appropriate restrictions.[1] In 2004, Orton became the youngest World Heavyweight Champion, when he won the title at the age of twenty-four.[10] His title win resulted in his departure from Evolution and feud with his former stablemates. In 2006, Orton joined forces with Edge in a tag team known as Rated-RKO. As a team, Orton and Edge held the World Tag Team Championship.[11] After the team disbanded, Orton, during the fall of 2007, won the WWE Championship twice in one night.[6]\n\nContents [hide]\n1 Early life \n2 Career \n2.1 Wrestling training \n2.2 World Wrestling Entertainment \n2.2.1 2002–2003 \n2.2.2 2004–2005 \n2.2.3 2006–2007 \n2.2.4 2008 \n3 In wrestling \n4 Championships and accomplishments \n5 Controversy \n6 Personal life \n7 Notes \n8 References \n9 External links \n \n\nEarly life\nOrton was born on April 1, 1980 in Knoxville, Tennessee.[2] Son to Elaine and \"\"Cowboy\"\" Bob Orton,[12] he is the eldest of two siblings—Becky and Nathan.[13] Knowing from experience the hardships of life as a professional wrestler, Orton's parents tried to convince him to stay away from wrestling, and his father warned him that life in the ring meant a life on the road, away from family.[1] Orton attended Hazelwood Central High School, where he was an amateur wrestler.[1] After graduating from Hazelwood in 1998,[5] Orton enlisted with the United States Marine Corps. There, he was dishonorably discharged a year later, after going AWOL on two separate occasions and disobeying an order from a commanding officer.[14] Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Private First Class Orton was tried and convicted under a special court-martial and was put into a military prison for thirty-eight days.[12]\n\nCareer\n\nWrestling training\nOrton first made his professional wrestling debut in 2000 with Mid-Missouri Wrestling Association-Southern Illinois Conference Wrestling (MMWA-SICW) in St. Louis, Missouri, an organization that was an off-shoot of the old St. Louis Wrestling Club headed by Sam Muchnick.[3] There, he was trained by both the promotion and his father, Cowboy Bob Orton.[12] During this time, Orton performed in matches with wrestlers such as Ace Strange and Mark Bland.[3][15] He worked at MMWA-SICW for a month.[15] Orton then refereed a few matches with World Organized Wrestling, a promotion where his uncle Barry Orton worked.[16] In 2001, Orton signed a deal with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and was sent to their farm territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued his training. During his time in OVW, Orton wrestled the likes of Rico Constantino and The Prototype and teamed with Bobby Eaton during a tag team title tournament.

{"prompt":"\"\n\nFailing to keep everything up-to-date\nHey Guys,\nI seem to notice that we I'm absent, NOT all of the stats, season summaries for teams, etc. are staying up-to-date. Take for example Richmond, their season summary has not been update even since I been overseas in Europe. I mean that I feel stressful that I'm the only one updating Collingwood's season summary and nobody else. Also with season summaries, I want to discuss with all of you about how if we should have ALL of the season summaries in either a list or Template:AFLGameDetailed form (I might already dicuss this here).  Another problem is that Wikipedians has been updating articles in various formats in which it really annoys me when I update stats myself. e.g. With the Win\/Loss table, I seem to notice that some Wikipedians have NOT bold the margin e.g. \"\"Port Adelaide 138\"\" rather than the preferred format \"\"Port Adelaide 138\"\". I notice that one lazy Wikipedian has decide to only update the Win\/Loss table for their favorite team () rather that both teams ( and ). I mean the whole idea is to keep the article up-to-date, it is? Speaking about updating in various formats, I seem to notice the ladder progression gets messy and untidy all of the time. I means that we should discuss this problem together on this page and settle down on ONE simple format that all of us Wikipedians can follow. One Final thing I want to talk about in this is NOT changing\/removing that already occurred in the past, I mainly notice that with the Win\/Loss table were vandals keeping removing the bold text with home teams and sometimes with the Ladder were people make up they own stats. Its drives me insane and people must start looking at the Ladder on the offical website here in order to update the Ladder on Wikipedia. I hope that you fellow Wikipedians take me seriously on this issue as I am finding it stressful enough updating many stats myself.\nThank you for your attention.\n\n''''''  \" ->","completion":" none"}

{"prompt":"Type 1 - missing the point \n\nDue to the general requirement of the use of some social engineering in this case (and normally in Type 0 vulnerabilities as well), many programmers have disregarded these holes as not terribly important.

If I wanted to grab cookies from users using some form of local JavaScript exploit (just an example, there are hundreds of other things possible), I could use a type 1 vulnerability on a forum or popular website in order to attack the maximum number of users. The social engineering side of it is therefore a side-note, as it only applies when an attacker is targeting one specific user - and even then if they know they frequent that site they don't have to social engineer them at all.\n\nFurthermore, what's with the names in the exploit scenarios?

The reference entirely supports the information in the National alliance article (and by the way, that newspaper is at least a worthy enough source as the defunct obscure newspaper where Redwood's letter to the editor appeared that is quoted at length. This is what the Friedman article says:\n\nHe also suggested consulting with Political Research Associates (PRA), a left-liberal investigative outfit with deep roots in the counterintelligence movement. Among its top researchers is former Public Eye editor Chip Berlet. PRA has been funded, in large part, by Richard Denis-a multi-millionaire Chicago commodities trader who was also one of the largest individual contributors to the Democratic Party in 1993. Bragging that he and researchers had worked with PRA \"\"for many years,\"\" King said: \"\"They have the best files in the country on political cults.\"\"\n.........\nBerlet, like King, has suspiciously changed his public views on NAP over the years. In 1984, when he first took over as editor of Public Eye, Berlet told Newman in a phone interview set up at Berlet's request to set the record straight regarding the Public Eye's 1977 accusation that Newman was a cultist and a LaRouchite, \"\"I'm the new kid on the block at Public Eye. I'm the new editor as opposed to the old editor, and if there was some way I could avoid having to write articles about this ongoing topic [NAP], I would. Our analysis of your group has changed over the past few years, drastically with my assumption to editor.\"\" The next issue of Public Eye contained the following editor's note: \"\"As you will learn from a forthcoming article on Fred Newman and the IWP [International Workers Party, a group that Newman had headed up in the mid seventies], the Public Eye no longer feels it is accurate to call Newman's political network a cult.\"\"\nThat \"\"forthcoming\"\" article, however, never appeared. Instead, three years later, right after Democratic Party high roller Denis contributed $75,000 to PRA, Berlet's Clouds Blur the Rainbow did.\nThe article clearly cites this in a NPOV manner as a claim that was made in a Newman publication, not as  fact, just like the claims of Redwood and every other critic and self-styled \"\"expert\"\" whose opinions permeate this article to a ridiculous extent already.  \" ->","completion":" none"}

Your participation in deletion debates is good.\n\nThe main objection in your RfA was \"\"Lack of policy experience\"\".  The basic reasoning is, that it is impossible for avid editors to read pages without editing them, so if you've read the policies and guidelines, that would show up in your contributions.  On guidelines you can generally make minor changes directly to the guidelines themselves.  With policies, unless it is fixing grammar or typos, you pretty much need to post the edits you want to make to the talk page for approval - but that becomes habit after you get used to it.  So my advice is that you start proofreading the P&G;'s, and see where that takes you.  I see David Fuchs has prepared a nomination for you.  Before you accept another nom, you should probably get in around 1000 meaningful edits to policy and guidelines pages and their respective talk pages, and about 500 edits in dispute resolution RFCs, s, some mediation, etc.  Then ask '''''\" ->","completion":" none"}

{"prompt":"NR post office \n\nHello - I came across your query on the discussion page for the New Rochelle Post Office. If you want the correct information you cannot rely on what Orlady has told you. She is the sole individual objecting to the use of the term 'mural' when referring to the artwork that is in the building. The building is a NRHP however not so much for the architectural significance, but for the murals inside. Specific reference to the term 'mural' can be seen in a number of sources that were provided.  These sources include very reliable documents including: United States Post Offices in New York  1858 to 1943  Thematic Resources (the National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form), The Westchester County Planning Board discussing the post office in relation to re-developing the site,further discussions,  and the New York Times article about the artist selected to paint the murals. The nomination form is the most irrefutable source validating the information (it specifically references two of the three murals when discussing the importance of post office art). Additionally, the city of New Rochelle continues with redevelopment of the area and has recently come to the decision that the significance of the building itself is minimal, with its only true attribute being the 'distinctive curved contour' of the front facade which is familiar to residents of the area and should be maintained. (Im sorry but I cant find this specific document at the moment). The continuing reverting of this information is entirely the result of Orlady who personally does not seem to care for the facts. Unfortunately it is resulting in a deficient and inaccurate article. I also should mention that blocking users as alleged puppets of a banned user seems to be the most useful means for Orlady to control the content of certain articles. She is clearly abusing the tool. The validity of her claims is questionable at best. I was blocked as a result of my contributions to this article, and was labeled a 'sock'. Considering that I am in no way connected to the banned user, I found it rather disturbing to be blocked based on 'evidence' that has absolutely no validity whatsoever.

Look for you self:\n\nEspionage or a dick spying on some pussy lovers involves an individual obtaining information that is considered secret or confidential without the permission of the holder of the information. Espionage is inherently clandestine, as the legitimate holder of the information may change plans or take other countermeasures once it is known that the information is in unauthorized hands. See clandestine HUMINT for the basic concepts of such information collection, and subordinate articles such as clandestine HUMINT operational techniques and clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting for discussions of the \"\"tradecraft\"\" used to collect this information.\nHey I gotta joke and it goes like this:Dick says \"\"Hey Balls get ready for a patry\"\" Balls replies \"\"You fucking liar. Everytime we go to a party, you always go in and leave us out here knockin.  \n\nHistory\nIncidents of espionage are well documented throughout history. The ancient writings of Chinese and Indian military strategists such as Sun-Tzu and Chanakya contain information on deception and subversion. Chanakya's student Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire, made use of assassinations, spies and secret agents, which are described in Chanakya's Arthasastra. The ancient Egyptians had a thoroughly developed system for the acquisition of intelligence, and the Hebrews used spies as well, as in the story of Rahab. Feudal Japan often used ninja to gather intelligence. More recently, spies played a significant part in Elizabethan England (see Francis Walsingham). Many modern espionage methods were well established even then. http:\/\/www.henrywotton.org.uk\/\n\nThe Cold War involved intense espionage activity between the United States of America and its allies and the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and their allies, particularly related to nuclear weapons secrets. Recently, espionage agencies have targeted the illegal drug trade and those considered to be terrorists.\n\nDifferent intelligence services value certain  intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred  human sources over  research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. Both Soviet political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU\n ) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited. \n\nVarious Forms\nUnlike other forms of  intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored, or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people to whom he was selling information.\n\nThe US defines espionage towards itself as \"\"The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defense with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. Espionage is a violation of 18 United States Code 792-798 and Article 106, Uniform Code of Military Justice{{cite web\n  | last = US Department of Defense\n  | authorlink = U.S. Department of Defense\n  | title = Joint Publication 1-02 Department of Defe ->","completion":" insult"}

{"prompt":"\"  Why did you delete my correspondance without reply?  Maybe it was accidental...if so here it is again.\n\n   Thanks for taking the time to explain Tokyogirl79.  I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's \"\"flat-earth society\"\" type behaviour that I find objectionable.\n\nI understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called \"\"community\"\".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the \"\"Speedy Deletion\"\" I could find no such option.\n\nWhen you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for \"\"Nassim Haramein\"\" and \"\"The Resonance Project\"\" in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-\"\"free\"\" encyclopedia. Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.\n\nThis new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.\n\nIf I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?\n\nBest Regards,\n\nJ\n\n\" ->","completion":" none"}

I am responsible for some of the strange indentation on the talk page section; I captured his 14 diffs from the outset and attempted to reason with Q, diff by diff; eventually  I attempted to recast his edits into inline tags; I annotated the disputed words, such as 'must' (current article) versus 'should'  (Q.g.s. rewording), etc. So you can see Qs views started out reasonably. \nAs Q proceeded down the article, he started deleting entire paragraphs, etc. So we stepped in per WP:BRD… That got his attention. Q decorated the article with top-level tags.  We started discussion, change by change. Q is fundamentally a well-read humanist. He has a theory of science based on his voluminous reading and training in history. So we have a difference in perspective which I would like to explore with Q and incorporate in the article. I attempted to get him to formulate his POV but Q's responses became attacks,  so I called Time out. To me, this proves Q is well-meaning, but Q also has strong opinions which I am attempting to draw out, somehow, without sacrificing the article.   The article remained tagged for over a month. The article is basically back to the Jan 1 state, but it also includes Tetrast's latest improvements.\nQs reasoning boils down to 'There was Science thousands of years ago. Therefore there was scientific method thousands of years ago', which does not follow. But we were never able to draw that out of him in so many words.

{"prompt":"Dear Readers, I have been forced to make some editorial changes due to the attack on my reputation. It is my personal opinion that the previous article is a smear job and attempts to slander my good name. A few points. Moving from Toronto to B.C was for one sole reason and that was to find work. There is no record of a criminal charge on my record of the so called soliciting a prostitute charge, thus it is not right to say so. I ask anyone to prove my criminal record includes such a charge. Furtermore while it is wholly true I have emailed the CPC and former YCl members, but not for some time and it is not a regular hobby. As a former communist I am concerned about any attempt to re-build that movement. Furthermore I am not a member of the pro-life board anymore and have not worked for Campaign Life since 2001. I still hold my persoanl views on the matter of abortion, and that is my right.\nIt has been stated in the press that the homosexual man beaten in that park was in fact participating in questionable behaviour in that park that media admits is frequented by gays. I in no way agree with the assualt what so ever and have never said such! Finally this question about pictures. The Manning picture was taken during a federal election and that is all. I do not force my self on political leaders and the picture was voluntary on Mannings part. Please prove otherwise.\nOnce last thing re the Mulroney dinner.

I can only assume that the person who made the changes did not read the page carefully.

Its yearly event, also known as the National Audio Theatre Festival, involves several days of instruction, training, special talks and other discussions on these topics. For example, training in sound mastering, sound production, voice acting.  The Friday night performance is the \"\"cherry on the sundae\"\". \n\nIt is one of the only conferences of its type worldwide. Many of the participants do NOT work on the radio at all, but in audio books, film or animation, and likewise, while all the training involves the audio arts, it is not just an \"\"audio drama festival\"\". The upcoming 2011 festival, for example, will be focusing on voice acting in animation.\n\nSeveral of the categories are rather egregious removals, such as \"\"Audio plays\"\", \"\"radio drama\"\", \"\"sound recording,\"\" \"\"sound technology\"\", and \"\"voice acting\"\", for which NATF is one of the only national training grounds or gathering for professionals... and even as other pages in those categories that are affiliated with NATF or are similarly themed stay in those categories.

I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with Igor Bogdanov, at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes.\nI was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it.\nBut where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling Igor Bogdanov a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the 3RR rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by Bidhonene who is a very endeared friend of YBM, for not being so usefull as she wish.\nAn article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang.\nJust as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the ´factual connection between YBM and this Voyer who infatuated this whole affair.\nIt was YBM who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this.\nBishonen blocked me 20 minutes after her protegé had been blocked.\ni dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight.\nYou can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit.\nShe didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it.\nShe has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between  her liking and her work as an admi.\nShe does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much.\nShe even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff.\nThe arbitration should have been about this too.\nThey are using the fact that mediator Nicholas turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds.\nAnd this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it.\nHe even insulted Nicholas turnbull.\nEasy when people aren't there to defend themselves.\nWiki english is a spot on the face of Wikipédia, admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing.\n\nThis has to stop.\nI asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate.\nHe has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request.\nThis don't go and has to be aborted.\nI do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it.\n\nNone of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration.\nIt is a close debate and not an arena game.\nTHis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning.\nHe is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted.\nHe must be removed as well.\ni dont accept what happened tonight.

{"prompt":"\"I am not sure. If the word \"\"denialist\"\" is new (which it is), you are unlikely to find a source calling an organization 100 or 150 years ago \"\"denialist\"\". You might find all the characteristics of what denialism is of course. \n\nIt depends on how you define denialism. If we define it very narrowly, we will only end up with 1 or 2 topics in the category of denialism, which clearly is wrong given the similarities of human behavior in those one or two areas with those in other subjects. \n\nI believe we should do what dictionaries do when they define a word: we look at prominent sources like the New York Times, the New York Review of Books, the London Times, the Economist, the Wall Street Journal, Academic  journals, scholarly writing, popular novels, etc to see how the word is used. For a new word, this determines its meaning, until a family of dictionary editors codifies this set of meanings as a family of different definitions that are published in dictionaries. Since we are not yet at the dictionary publication stage, but at the earlier pre- dictionary publication stage, we have to do more of the hard work ourselves. That is all. \n\nIt is clearly a common word, in common usage, at least in some subject areas. One rarely hears the word \"\"AIDS denier\"\" although that is essentially what an \"\"AIDS denialist\"\" is (parenthetically noting that in fact an AIDS denialist is really an \"\"HIV denialist\"\", properly speaking). And I suspect the phrase \"\"Holocaust denier\"\" will fade from usage now that the new word \"\"denialist\"\" seems to be gaining popularity. \n\nIf one maintains that there are two separate groups, denialists and deniers, then why are there no AIDS deniers? Why no HIV deniers? Only denialists? Seems a bit strange, given that human behavior is not much different in all these cases; only the topic changes. The denying stays the same. \n\nIf putting someone in a denialism category constitutes libel, then a very large number of publications worldwide have put themselves in legal jeopardy by publishing articles on AIDS denialists and other kinds of denialists. Given that these publications have full time legal staff and large legal budgets, and the people making these claims on Wikipedia are not lawyers or legal experts, this claim seems dubious at best. \n\nIf we accept the gratuitous personal assertions of some that denialism is really a political movement that involves personal gain, then creationists, creation scientists and intelligent design promoters fall in this category. If \"\"denialism\"\" is more like denial of the evidence, then this is less obviously true, since there is a dispute about the evidence in these cases. \n\nIf we define \"\"denialism\"\" as some here claim, to only mean those that know they are lying about the truth, then where does that leave the most common usage of the word in the phrase \"\"AIDS denialism\"\" ? It obviously cannot mean \"\"lying knowingly\"\" in this case, or probably in all cases. \n\nI suggest that if one requires a publication to directly make the claim that \"\"X is a Y\"\", to put some article in a category, then we would depopulate most of the categories on Wikipedia. If Y has characteristics {Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4...Yn} from dictionary definitions or from common usage, and this common usage is well-understood and evident from publication in WP:V and WP:RS sources as defined above, and if X has most if not all of the characteristics {Y1, Y2, Y3...Yn}, then surely X can be put in the category Y. \n\nFor example, suppose we define a new type of urban area called a \"\"Townlet\"\", being an area with a common administration within a radius of 5 kilometers and a permanent human population of 5000-10000 people. Then one surely does not need a publication to state that \"\"Filllsberg is a Townlet\"\" to put Filllsberg, meeting all the necessary criteria, in the category \"\"Townlet\"\". \n \nI also vehemently deny the assertion that \"\"denialist\"\" is a singularly negative category and so should not be used. If so, we would get rid of a large number of categories, such as \"\"pseudoscience\"\". \n\nAlso, as I have stated repeatedly, \"\"transhumanists\"\" or \"\"secular humanists\"\" or \"\"aetheists\"\" might be viewed as denialists by some. And might feel perfectly proud to proclaim themselves as denialists of some overwhelming belief or putative evidence. \n\nFor these reasons, I think there is nothing wrong with having a category called \"\"denialist\"\", or \"\"denialism\"\". The membership of this category might be controversial, depending on what we take as the definition of the word. Any particular subject might or might not be put in that category, given community consensus on the word's definition, and on the individual case by case analysis of any particular topic, subject or article.  \n\n\" ->","completion":" none"}

When you include information on the \"\"targeting of innocents to achieve a political goal\"\" Hiroshima and Nagasaki were military targets and were defended by an air force. What you have included, and reverted to goes on about the use of air power in unrelated conflicts as if that too were \"\"terrorism\"\". \"\"Terrorism\"\" and \"\"terror\"\" \"\"terrifying\"\" are different things.

{"prompt":"Jane Austen's \n\nHi, I happen to have Tony1's talk page on my Watchlist left over from some ancient exchange, so I noticed your query about removing the full dates of birth and death of Jane Austen. Discouraging (without banning) month and day of birth or death is not consensus, although it is the strong opinion of many editors, disputed by many others, at at a straw poll currently being  conducted at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers). Since Jane Austen's editors have apparently decided against having an Information Box (which could display exact birthday and date of death), I think the argument for keeping them quickly accessible in this particular lead is rather stronger. And although I'm more of a Dickensian than an Austenite myself, I know several people in the San Francisco Bay Area who diligently celebrate Jane Austen's birthday with an annual ball.

{"prompt":"\"\n\n= More a fault of interpretation  \n\nMr Shyamal, \n\nIn your answer, one notices very well that you still made an error, because you fix yourselves on the imaginary scientific value of Rognes or of the americains, by hating the objective value of the other authors and in particular of Lehrer.  To better explain you the taxonomic situation of the kind Bengalia s. str., I request from you do not consider that I insult certain characters of current taxonomy and to see reality exactly exposed by me. \n\nNo author who occupied himself more or less tangentially with Bengaliidae, admits that Bengalia testacea  R.D. is the species-type of the Bengalia kind.  Only Rognes, which copied Sabrosky (1999:62), which knew this group of dipterous in same measurement as Rognes, wrote (with the collaboration of bibliographical and nonscientific impostors:  Neal L Evenhuis and F.C. Thompson) that this type is the nomen nudum  B. testacea  indicated by Duponchel (1842)(?!).  Thus, which makes N.L Evenhuis, J. E. O' Hara, T. Pape and A. C. Pont are only of copy and to transcribe exactly the silly things of Sabrosky, without any proof or analyze scientific.  Moreover, because these authors are good friends with Rognes, it also added \"\" Valid genus [ tests  Rognes (2006:467) ] \"\", but not validates species-type.  But, can you say which tests was made by Rognes?,  who knows nothing on Bengaliidae, which made the most stupid silly things in its work, which does not know the morphological terminology of their genitalia male, which mixes the drawings of the authors for the different species to make its new taxa, which makes the photography of the microscopic preparations of the species studied by Lehrer and deposited in the Natural history museum of London and which affirms that those are clean taxonomic imaginations?  Don't you believe my assertions?  Then I recommend to you to read, for a good documentation of your encyclopaedia, work of Lehrer of his review Fragmenta Dipterologica:  2008(18):1-4;  2010(23):1-22 and 22-25; 2010(24):20-24 and 24-30;  2010(25):1-4 and work:  LEHRER & WEI, 2010, a new Eastern kind of the family Bengaliidae (Diptera) - Bull. Ploughshare ent.  Mulhouse, 66(2)21-25.  \nThus you can understand that Rognes is incomparable being unaware of, which wanted to make taxonomic \"\" revolutions \"\" with the language devoted to its handicapped pupils of the school of Stavanger (Norway) where it works and with the mystifications of literature and information.  Moreover, you can consider only the work of Evenhuis &Comp.;  of Zootaxa an authority in the taxonomy of Bengaliidae constitutes, because they never studied the species of the group and in particular ?, because all the authors, of Zumpt (1956) and until Lehrer (2010) consider that Bengalia labiata  R.D. is the species-type of the Bengalia kind.

Amazing.\n\nAlright, so clean this page and leave this message here. Erase other extra crap. Alright, looks like we are in business. BTW, I know this is probably bull, but if any of you two actually are not trolling, which is highly unlikely, than post request an admin to come by so I can clear this account up. But I have this sinking feeling you guys all knew what's been going on here this whole time, and I have no patience to search through tons of pages to find ONE contact I can talk to about this block, so you might have this account, but you won't get the other one. Suck doesn't it? Until then, I will be going about my day and you guys will most likely probably still be doing this for X amount of days cause I guess you think it's funny?

{"prompt":"August 2008 (UTC)\n\n[unindent]\nLike the CFers, I don’t think voting defines this issue, particularly when critical information has been withheld from the voters.  Let's look at tat briefly...\n\nFrom the Wiki page on pseudoscience we find:\n\n“As it is taught in certain introductory science classes, pseudoscience is any subject that appears superficially to be scientific or whose proponents state is scientific but nevertheless contravenes the testability requirement, or substantially deviates from other fundamental aspects of the scientific method.[3]”\n\nFrom the Wiki page on the scientific method, we find:\n\n“Among other facets shared by the various fields of inquiry is the conviction that the process be objective to reduce a biased interpretation of the results. Another basic expectation is to document, archive and share all data and methodology so they are available for careful scrutiny by other scientists, thereby allowing other researchers the opportunity to verify results by attempting to reproduce them. This practice, called full disclosure, also allows statistical measures of the reliability of these data to be established.”\n\nFrom my comments in the “Bias on both sides” section on this page we find:\n\nThe assertion that published studies on He in ‘cold fusion’ experiments came from air leaks, that this necessitates that the CFers perform ‘full disclosure’ on their experimental results and methods, and that that has not yet been done.\n\nand:\n\nThe assertion that heavy metals found in cold fusion experiments comes from a) contaminants or b) improper analysis of data, that this necessitates that the CFers perform ‘full disclosure’ on their experimental results and methods, and that that has not yet been done.\n\nAnd from my other comments on calorimetry (incl. edits to the CF  Wiki page), we find:\n\nThe assertion that apparent excess heat arises from an analytical method problem, that the CFers exclude these concerns based on a dislike of a proposed speculative physical\/chemical mechanism that might or might not be a source of a calibration constant shift problem, while ignoring the mathematical fact that a 1-3% change in cal. constants can account for the large majority of such heat claims.  One fundamental aspect of the scientific method is the concept that if two alternative explanations exist for a given set of observations, then the situation is undefined and more new work must be done designed to test each alternative and distinguish between the two, because two distinct, conflicting explanations for a phenomenon can’t both be correct.  Failure to do that substantially deviates from other fundamental aspects of the scientific method.  Failure to incorporate a viable alternative into experimental protocols produces a biased interpretation of the results.\n\nSeems to me we need a new vote…     18:48, 22 ->","completion":" none"}

{"prompt":"I think that it is unlikely that good faith is as much of an issue for most of us as is being unconsciously blind to our own biases. It is clear that Rhwentworth is highly invested in NVC, and while he may have a business COI, I think it is more likely he would simply like to protect NVC from what he sees, given his expertise, as unfair criticism. Sunray is more curious. S\/he has, in my opinion, been extremely defensive, tendentious and aggressive, having accused several of us of wikilawyering and harboring a hidden agenda against NVC, as well as claiming we had reached consensus when in fact the defenders (mostly me) had simply given up, having felt bulldozed. S\/he has also consistently removed material from the criticisms section, because s\/he incorrectly assessed the sources, could not find a convenient link to the source, or because the source was deemed inappropriate for criticismyet left the source in place for material elsewhere in the article. I have no idea why Sunray is so aggressive about critiques of NVC, but I doubt it is a COI or bad faith.\n\nThe strong objections to the critiques by a number of pro-NVC advocates, such as Sunray and Rhwentworth, essentially consist of the idea that there are no valid criticisms of NVC. In the previous arguments over these sources, the substance of the objection came down to either rejecting the source as unreliable (for criticism but not for promotion) or claiming that the source misunderstands NVC and thus is simply wrong. So at this point, the only critique of NVC we have noted in the article is that it lacks critique. Given the strong and diverse critiques of NVC that have been published, this is sad to me.\n\nI pointed out that disparaging of the sources of criticism of NVC as being unreliable, minority, inaccurate etc. should also apply to the sources supporting NVC. On this talk page, I went through every reference in the article and showed that they were nearly all from promotional or minority literature. It is hard to find traditionally reliable (e.g. academic, peer-reviewed, mainstream, etc.) sources for any aspect of NVC. This has marginally improved.\n\nI suggested previously that we have a responses section rather than a critique or criticisms section, which I hoped would allow some of the responses from non-academic or non-traditional sources to be aired in the article. We have been stuck arguing about the academic sources, however, so I am thinking that the less reliable sources would not be accepted. \n\nI believe that beyond the argument we are having about sources for explicit criticism of NVC, there are other big issues. The article was originally criticized by editors as sounding promotional, and we made some headway in fixing this. Lately, however, the article has again been rewritten, in my opinion, to promote NVC. This consists of burying information that might cast NVC in a less than glorious light and by making the article essentially a description of how the advocates of NVC see it as working, rather than putting it into a context for naive readers. For example, Sunray argued very strongly that NVC is not a conflict resolution technique, but is a trademark of an organization and therefore should not be criticized under the BLP policy. I then added the information that NVC is trademarked to the intro, but this was removed to the very end of the article. (Perhaps there should be an 'sm' next to each mention of NVC, since it is a trademarked item.) The one study of NVC efficacy described in detail in the article as research was published in a non-peer-reviewed newsletter. This information was removed to the reference section rather than staying in the article itself, where I put it. The fact that there is nearly no discussion, research or confirmation of NVC in the literature was removed from the introduction to become the sole critique of NVC, at the end of the article. And, as one of the sources on NVC notes, one critique of NVC is that it is based on beliefs rather than research. This is no longer mentioned in the article explicitly. \n\nAs far as moving forward, I think the Gorsevski and the Flack sources are high quality and the reasons adduced for exclusion do not seem sufficient. I do not think we have to go into any detail on the contents of their critiques, but we should mention they exist and provide a citation. I also think that one major critique of NVC is that many organization have attempted to adopt it and found it problematic. This is the opinion of one of our high quality academic (and pro-NVC) sources. I think a sentence to this effect should be included, with the reference. I also think it would be legitimate to include here the opencouchsurfing.com and noesis.org mention, and Sarles self-published critique (which is discussed in the academic source). The pro-NVC academic sources are not afraid to address the critiques, so I am not sure why t ->","completion":" none"}

{"prompt":"\"\n\nWell, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can't kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:\n\nIn recent years especially after the 9\/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today’s useful idiots. \n\n[Ali Sina] states: “They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.”  The same author writes: “More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, \"\"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.\"\" Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.” \n\nMuslims obviously don't like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. \n\nIn Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech?  \n\nFunny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. \n\nIf you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? \n\nI am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? \n\nSorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2 ->","completion":" identity"}

Paint, cages and other cover-ups can not remove the actual history. Sure there have been previous wars over the content. I have been involved for over thirteen years getting the documents, interviews and real history of the tragedy, while trying to correct the media's versions, which are full of errors and out right misinformation. If some of the articles on the net and in the history of the media were used, Houston McCoy would be \"\"George McCoy\"\", Whitman would be the Devil or evil (read Gary Lavergne's \"\"Why Did He Do IT\"\" on his website (this is the author of \"\"A Sniper In The Tower\"\", who claimed the tower tragedy was the \"\"Worst Mass Murder In American History\"\", which I fought and proved that Andrew Kehoe was the worst until Whitman). Also, in Lavergne's article, he claims Whitman would be alive as of August 1, 2006, if the Supreme Court had not banned the death penalty a few years after the tragedy, even though Whitman had a Glioblastoma Grade IV brain tumor that would have killed him within a year - even if he had not gone up in the tower. All Jimbo Wales has ever done is react to the protests and misguided rule benders like BZUK and Gavia immer, who know nothing about the tragedy or the rules of a valid contribution. They (Gavia and BZUK), are just like Wales, memes who have no knowledge of what they are doing, just applying their own personal bias' for what they blindly consider acts of vandalism, with no proof, and not even looking at the contribution and it's sourcing.

He deletes info about european history even if such info is based upon accurate inferences. Why he does this should be the subject of debate. My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim. Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european.
