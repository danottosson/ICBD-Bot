{"prompt":"\"\nThanks for the copy-edit, OMG it reads so professional. ) I appreciate it a lot. Yeah, I knew that that would be a problem. Okay, here's the \"\"back story\"\" to it. Danny had body paint while he was a robot during a sketch. During the after party, in which the theme was a black light one, everybody could see that Danny still had paint on him, as it hadn't washed off or something. To be sure, Jack had a black light switch in his apartment, and when Liz came in, he turned it on, which resulted in Liz having the paint all over her, see here. Or if whatever I just said doesn't make sense, read here and here (about the paint still on Danny and the black light attack).\nYeah, I thought maybe if people saw that, the GA note, they won't leave me a message.

I'm leaving a note here because you closed this AfD, where I made a commitment to do as you instructed in the closing statement. There are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article, one of whom has used a series of user names (unacknowledged on his current user page but available , so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the 'suppress' camp). I complain here about their coordination. Other editors, including  and I simply can't do it any longer.

I'm done. I need to limit my time on Wikipedia at present, and wish for that time to be spent pleasantly and productively. When I've made a commitment, though, it grieves me not to keep it.

{"prompt":"\"\n\nAlex, thank you for your reply.\nI could indeed use a break from this case, but yesterday was a very eventful day, as the case closed and then AGK answered a question I'd initially posed on August 22, meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which I had a chance to respond to the FoF, and then when it made the response, it not only confirmed the \"\"judgment on content\"\" aspect of the FoF, if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with Arzel in which Arzel not only ignores the content of academically published RS, he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the Formisano text, for example, had been under direct discussion.\n\nRegarding the perceived legal threat, I had no intention to make a legal threat. That was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case, starting with NewYorkBrad's comment on my FoF on August 23, to which AGK refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday, more than two weeks later. There were also email exchanges between myself and NYB and AGK, which I will have to forward to Jimbo Wales at some point, after clarifying one point made by NYB on his talk page.\n\nThe import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as I make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that AGK aspires to become an attorney (or whatever they're called in Scotland). It is secondly an indication that I have taken the time to register at Wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments I had made about \"\"the court of public opinion\"\". And when did a little looking around there, finding an entry about NYB, for example, who had advised AGK that he didn't see any misconduct in some of the points of the FoF, so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney. \n\nIf the reiteration of material deleted by AGK from his User page within the past two weeks is \"\"outing\"\", then that is a policy I shall have to examine. Note that I am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue.\n\nThere's much more to say on this, but I need to get a couple more hours of sleep. I have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at Jimbo's talk page, but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation, not even contrasting the complete lack of an FoF on Arzel, for instance, with the response provided to me on the PD talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday.\n\nIf this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions, and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished, I would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system.  é£çµ¡ è¦å­¦\/è¿·æ \" ->","completion":" none"}

The second keep was stronger, but again didn't really address the points above, and was more along the lines of WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS. As We66er said, removing the redlinks would leave a list of five, which defeats the object of a \"\"list\"\". On the counter side of that argument, redlinks show potential for new articles, but when there are so many redlinks, there is no need for such a list. There were many items on the list, yet only a handful were referenced, and as another said, one of the organisations on that list had been deleted previously through AfD. The strongest keep therefore was WP:STAND, but that was struck as a result of misinterpretation. This is the full reason for my close. However, deleting admins don't generally say any more than \"\"keep\"\" or \"\"delete\"\" in their closing statement, unless 1) there is a specific reason for the delete and\/or 2) it was a decision that could cause controversy.

{"prompt":"Type 1 - missing the point \n\nDue to the general requirement of the use of some social engineering in this case (and normally in Type 0 vulnerabilities as well), many programmers have disregarded these holes as not terribly important. This misconception is sometimes applied to XSS holes in general (even though this is only one type of XSS) and there is often disagreement in the security community as to the importance of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.\nThis section misses the entire point. If I wanted to grab cookies from users using some form of local JavaScript exploit (just an example, there are hundreds of other things possible), I could use a type 1 vulnerability on a forum or popular website in order to attack the maximum number of users. The social engineering side of it is therefore a side-note, as it only applies when an attacker is targeting one specific user - and even then if they know they frequent that site they don't have to social engineer them at all.\n\nFurthermore, what's with the names in the exploit scenarios?

Gains have been fairly uniform across the entire range of black cognitive ability.[28] J. Philippe Rushton and Arthur R. Jensen have disputed Dickens's and Flynn's findings, calculating a mean gain for Blacks of zero to 3.44 IQ points, and questioned the exclusion of four independent tests that showed low or negative IQ gains.[33] However, in the very same 2006 study that was criticized by Rushton and Jensen, Flynn and Dickens give explicit reasons for why four tests were excluded. Rushton and Jensen include in test such as the AFQT which is not strictly an IQ tests and their inclusion of Herrnstein and Murray's AFQT data was criticized by Flynn and Dickens. Rushton and Jensen derive the figure of a 3.44 IQ point gain by adding data from four excludes tests to Table A1 while Flynn and Dickens' figure of a 5.5 IQ gain for black Americans was derived from Figure 3 in the study.[34]\"\"\n1.

Swordfish made that revert on the basis of wanting reliable sourcing (he had not followed the wikilinks included in the added text to see that the point is more than adequately sourced and not at all controversial); I directed him to those sources and he has made no objection to my reintroducing the content so far.  The fact that I made my case in an edit summary is utterly irrelevant  there is no policy requiring me to start a superfluous talk page entry as opposed to making the sources known through any other venue or means of discussion on the project.    And in approaching the matter in this way, I in no way violated the principle of WP:Consesus, to which I am fully committed as an editor; had Swordfish reverted again, I would have opened a discussion on the article's talk page, but it's not your place to just assume his reaction to my new evidence and insist on a particular course of action in resolving the (non)issue between the two of us.  Your actions in this case, and especially your tone in your edit summaries, seem to suggest that you feel you are in a position to dictate the methodologies of other editors with regard to work flow and communication, but in this case you have no policy argument to support this behaviour and no special position in the community entitling you to interfere in this manner, especially when you had no reason to believe the matter was not already dealt with to the satisfaction of the original parties involved.\n\nThis was a discussion based on WP:Verifiability alone, a matter that, until someone tells me otherwise, seems to have been resolved.

{"prompt":"\"\n\n I heard you like hamburgers. \n\n  The Hamburglar is a McDonaldland character who features in McDonald's commercials. He is a close friend of Ronald McDonald, Grimace, and Birdie. Even though he has always attempted (and failed) to hoard all the hamburgers in McDonaldland for himself, he has always been looked upon as a valued member of the McDonaldland community.\n\nHistory\nDespite a few changes made to his appearance over the years, he has always been endearingly loved by fans all over the world. A pint-sized burglar who first appeared in March 1971 and was one of the first villains on the commercials. He was dressed in a black-and-white hooped shirt and pants, a red cape, a wide-brimmed hat, and red gloves. His primary object of theft was hamburgers, hence his name. The character, like Grimace, started out as a villain, only he was old, had a long nose, gray hair, and was called the Lone Jogger in some 1970s commercials, sporting a shirt that said \"\"Lone Jogger\"\". Hamburglar spoke in gibberish which was often translated by Captain Crook.\n\nHe was revised in 1985, when his look changed from a trollish old man to a red-head Dennis the Menace-type child who spoke and wore a shorter-brimmed hat and a black cape with yellow on the inside. His previously-unintelligible muttering was now the familiar \"\"robble robble.\"\" In \"\"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald,\"\" he took on a new, sporty appearance wearing green goggles, a leather jacket, striped shirt, shorts and sneakers. He loved playing tricks on his friends and still loved burgers. The last appearances of Hamburglar on television were prime time commercials promoting the dollar menu. Hamburglar was voiced by Howard Morris in most commercials, Charlie Adler in some 1980s commercials and \"\"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald\"\"; and Carl W. Wolfe in some 1990s commercials.\nHamburglar 2015\nIn 2015, new images were released by McDonald's depicting the Hamburglar as a grown man wearing a fedora, a macintosh jacket atop a black-and-white t shirt, with black jeans and with high-top sneakers. He still has a mask, but his face now also sports a good half-inch of designer stubble. The character will be in commercials for the first time since 2002.   \" ->","completion":" none"}

{"prompt":"I never said it would happen. I just said that I wouldn't be suprsed if it does. I made that guess based on everything that's happened so far in Naruto, and the way Kishimoto creates plot twists of this kind. Now your comment is what seems fanboyish and unjustifiable. Kabuto already seemed to have a kind of kind of second nature back during the first part of the series where his eyes would change color when he got mad. Kishimoto wouldn't give him a similar state to Juugo, because it wouldn't be something that new and because he wouldn't want to have two characters be so similar. And as for my Orochimaru possesing Itachi theory, just because something happens at one point doesn't mean it will be the same story next time. By your logic, just because Kakashi needed the help of his students (look 2-3 people right there!) to bail him out of Zabuza's trap during their first meeting, that would mean Zazbuza could have easily killed him during their second meeting when they were fighting alone. Or just because even Gaara's own father, the Kazekage himself, feared Gaara's power, a genin like Naruto shouldn't have been able to beat him let alone after he transformed. Or how could the Uchiha, being the strongest clan of Konoha, be killed so easily by a single member of their village? See? You definetly chose the wrong story to bring up that kind of logic. Practically every single fight in Naruto craps all over it. Orochimaru COULD take over Kabuto, and go on to Itachi after Sasuke's team has weakened him. Perhaps they cause him to overuse his Sharingan eyes, who knows? Orochimaru could find him, make his move, steal his body, and seek vengeance on Sasuke.

{"prompt":"No it is not reasonable to assume. In fact, virtually every mutant power has been completely missrepresented and changed in this movie series. Further, almost every facet of the characters lives have been changed in this movie series, so just because something happens in one continuity doesn't mean it will happen in another. Further, the section is about his appearance in the movie, not in the comic, so any details from the comic are completely irrelevant for his character. And using his comic book powers for reasons why the film makers would bring him back is an opinion. His body is completely charaed. Every character said he is dead. The creators of the film have not gone on reccord saying he is coming back or hinting at it or anything of this nature. The mentioning of his near deathes happened in the comicbook, not in the movie. This section is about his appearance in the movie, therefore, adding comic information in reference to his comic character is irrelevent. Further, CAPITALIZING your words does not porve anything and is completely silly. Find a source that says he didn't die from the movie, or the creators, or anything. Do not use comic books as an argument. Although the films have basis in the comics, the film makers only take what they want and have shown considerable creative license throughout this film to change stories as they see fit (sebastian shaws origins and powers, weakening of magneto by only showing his magnetic abilities, making havok not be cyclopse's younger brother, changing mistiques origins, changing azazel's origins, etc). Therefore, you can only talk about Darwin's appearance in the movie, as he appears in the movie. His body is completely destroyed, every character said he is dead.

This is not to say that there aren't ways for non-mainstream points of view to be incorporated into articles, and is certainly not meant to imply the correctness of one view over another.

And when it comes to external links\/further reading (not \"\"sources\"\"), then traditionalist websites deserve to be represented as much as others. I mean, on a page on Hannukah, there might be a link to \"\"An Orthodox Hannukah\"\" or \"\"Reformed Readings for Hannukah,\"\" but with Dominick it seems to be only his way or no way. He can't add a link for balance, or add \"\"a traditional Catholic site\"\" tag, or group links under headings as you did; he removes and replaces and mischaracterizes in the edit summaries.\n\nI am totally fine with any links to my site being labelled \"\"a traditional Catholic site\"\" or what not (though I think the same thing ought to work in the other direction such that EWTN, for ex., is labelled a \"\"conservative\"\" or \"\"neo-conservative\"\" site  not that I am worked up about going through Wiki and making it so, but the point remains). \n\nI'm glad you liked at least most of the page on the Rosary!

Seriously, check this section of the site out, and the sub-sections inside of it, like the \"\"Customs of the Liturgical Year\"\" section. There is nothing like it out there on the Net, and I'm not finished yet!) But your words show the key differences between traditionalists and conservatives\/neo-conservatives: you use the phrase \"\"attacks on Pope John Paul II\"\" with regard to the footnote about trads' opinions that changing the Mysteries of the Rosary was unwise, but we don't see it as an \"\"attack\"\" but a criticism. Even St. Paul himself resisted St. Peter, our first Pope, \"\"to the face\"\" when His Holiness did an unwise thing (Galatians 2), and St. Catherine of Siena used to write letters to the Pope, basically telling him to act like a man LOL Our differences pretty much come down to different understandings of infallibility, to perceptions of our ability to criticize and resist prudential, pastoral decisions, and to our different notions of Christian obedience (and here different trads have different opinions as to what should be obeyed or rightfully resisted, because that is a prudential concern in itself, one that each Catholic has to study and pray about).\n\nBut no matter whether you and Dominick and I agree or not (we don't have to agree to be decent to each other, and some of my favorite people are conservative Catholics!), there is a trad \"\"movement\"\" out there, and we have as much \"\"right\"\" to be heard as anyone else. Or imagine that we're not even Catholic at all and there's a page on the Rosary: no one would remove a link to \"\"Anglican Rosary practices.\"\" I just feel as if the traditional viewpoint is being censored, and it frustrates me (it doubly frustrates me when links like this aren't only removed, but are labelled \"\"blog\"\" or \"\"[[monograph|monographs]\"\". It's beyond belief, really, that he is allowed to get away with it).\n\nI will promise you this: from here on out, if I add any links to the site (only on relevant pages, of course), I will use the word \"\"a traditional Catholic site\"\" or some such after it, or will group links so that the fact that it is a trad site is clear. If I come across any older links that have already been added (and not all have been added by me, BTW), I will edit to do the same.

{"prompt":"\"\n\nDear C.Fred, this is ridiculous. I'm just conveying a fact, and Wikipedia is blocking me as soon as I do. I'm like the boy that states the fact that the emperor is naked, and you're among the public that tells him to be quiet. Can you please tell me what I possibly can write about clades and cladistics that will not block me? Anything that isn't right on the point? Cladistic is is in fact a mental desease. Is it possible to say that a mental desease is a mental desease? At the same time as Object-Oriented modeling is making great progress in geographical information systems (like you can see on CNN almost every night illustrating statistics for US and parts of it) and in a multitude of other applications, the inconsistent, self-contradictory and empirically erroneous cladism holds its fort against it by oppression of its opponents (for example blocking me). I have supported my statements with facts, and none of the influential cladists even dare to challenge them. Gareth Nelson tried every night for at least five months without success. The fact that he even tried is a measure of the importance he assesses them. In this continuing blocking of me, Wikipedia at least has to set a time limit as to when it regards the facts I'm stating (i.e., that time is relative) as being generally accepted (among cladists?). This discussion is totally and utterly ridiculous. Cladism does in fact deny that time can be relative, instead claiming that it is relations that are are relative, that is, that relative is relative. How long do we have to continue discussing a paranoia? Why not just conclude that it is a paranoia? Cladists don't understand that it is they that conceptualize reality, but instead think they find concepts. They think things have conceptual labels all around them, that they are branded. It is ridiculous, ridiculous... \n\nI thus contest being blocked for telling the truth. I argue that if telling the truth in itself is a reason for being blocked, then Wikipedia can certainly not be allocated to the category 'encyclopedia', since the definition of this concept surely must include telling the truth (to the best of its ability). If Wikipedia contest this argument, then I demand a specification of which part(s) of it. (I, however, have no illusions. I expect this contest to lead to my blocking from this page too. I expect to be blocked everytime I tell the truth. It doesn't stop me. I will continue telling the truth until it penetrates cladists foggy brains, or at least diagnoses their foggy brains as the foggy brains they are. In the meantime, Wikipedia will have major problems trying to hinder their confusion to spread to phylogenetics, evolution, medicine and maybe even science itself. Cladism actually hates science in its traditional form, i.e., as described by Karl Popper, and is presently trying to roll out its confusional mat over it. Just read the \"\"explanation\"\" of phylogenetics and you have to understand what I mean. It is totally impossible to make \"\"heads and tails\"\" of. If it belongs in an encyclopedia, then I'm Santa, Cladism is not science, but rather a reaction against science). Consist (presently at 83.254.20.53  )\" ->","completion":" none"}

I just mean that if they donât know (or just pretend that donât know) that Lucifugum is one of the most known East European black metal bands and give them just a half of a sentence of 3 pages they donât look terribly competent in this subject. Just in this subject, I donât talk about their whole competence. Donât you agree?  As for the album a year on own label: Lucifugum is a self-releasing band just last 5 years (of 15 years existence). And it doesnât make them less notable than they were in past. In interviews they explained their decision to make self-releases. Itâs just because of a disappointment in labels which didnât keep their word and promises (but NOT because of lack of interest to the band). âVector 33â (the first album of  female fronted Lucifugum) was planned to be released on Drakkar prod., but  Drakkar didnât release it in due time. Thatâs why Lucifugum have canceled the deal with Drakkar and released âVector 33â cd by themselves. It was the first Propaganda cd release. Also in Lucifugum interviews I read that they donât exclude the cooperation with labels in future if they find a noble label with honest principles. By the way, âStigma Egoismâ on Drakkar prod. is not a re-release, this is the first (and last at the moment) cd edition of this album (Propaganda released just tape version). Also Lucifugum released in 2003 two albums on BlackMetal.Com on cd format (a big independent American label with many releases and good financial might). I mean a critery for musicans, Lucifugum released 3 albums on big indie labels.    \nP.S. They record an album a year (or almost a year) not just now, in early times they did the same things.

{"prompt":"\"\n\nThe Catholic Church example is a good one, but I'd like to point out several key distinctions. First off, its an old enough institution that a separate History of the Catholic Church article exists, which makes the main article in reality The current status of the Catholic Church or maybe A summary of the Catholic Church, this is not the case for the NRA. We have a single article that is trying to address its entire history along with its cumulative activities, so the Lead needs to reflect that. Second, with all of the various controversy involving the Church, none of it mentioned until the last paragraph. Third, it's Lead 1st sentence is fairly generic simply stating that its the largest organization of its type and how many members it has. I would be fine with something similar, \"\"The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) is a nonprofit organization with 5 million members.\"\" But quite frankly, that seems too simplistic and not terribly descriptive or informative.\n\nFurthermore, if we take a clinical look at what they do today, its a variety of things that range from publishing and multi-media (television, internet, etc.) to training and certification programs to historical preservation along with lobbying and other political activities. So to describe the organization in the 1st sentence using any kind of phrase that includes \"\"gun control\"\", gun rights\"\", or the like is just bad writing and purposely ignoring significant parts of the article, hence my original suggestion for the Lead first sentence. At the very least, I don't see why the first sentence can't just be generically descriptive. Maybe something like, \"\"The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) is a nonprofit organization that primarily serves as an advocate for firearm related issues and activities. Originally founded in 1871 in New York by journal editor William Conant Church and General George Wood Wingate to promote marksmanship within the United States military, the organization has gone through several transformations as well as expanded its purpose and goals. In the 21st century, it has become one of the largest and most influential lobbyist groups in Washington D.C. as well as a large, multi-title magazine publisher, an advocate for hunters, outdoorsmen, and the , and one of the largest firearm training and certification program operators in the U.S.\"\"\n\nThat said, I will try to find other examples, but given this list (:Category:501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations) it does not seem difficult to find an article with a Lead first sentence like I've described. By the way, I'm advocating for a rewrite of the ENTIRE WP:Lead, not just the 1st sentence. I think that Policy is fairly clear, but IMO to adhere to it properly in this case Editor's need, to quote the WP:Lead page, a specialized understanding of the subject in order to write it in a NPOV manner that a non-specialist will understand.

{"prompt":"\"\n\n When will Man be ready to accept that our Time is not the Time of the Universe? \n\nhttp:\/\/www.fitinizini.com\/theories_01.html\n\nTheory of Multi-Dimensional Scalable Worlds\nBy Dr. Fortunato Da COSTA in Theory of Multi-Dimensional Scalable Worlds * \n\n\"\"When will Man be ready to accept that our Time is not the Time of the Universe?\"\" \n\nPrinciple I â Empiric â Entity and World Scale relationship: \nIn the Universe each Entity (constellation, star, planet, animal, vegetable, micro organism, molecule, â¦) belongs to its own WORLD SCALE defined by two major dimensions the LIFE SCALE (Average Life Time Scale) and the SPACE SCALE (Average Size Scale) of the Entity. \n\nPrinciple II â Empiric â The fulfillment principle: \nEach particular Entity, in its Space Scale, has everything needed to complete its life cycle and in its respective Life Scale there is enough time to, also, complete its life cycle with success. \n\nPrinciple III â Empiric â World Scales existence: \nAccording to our human kind World Scale there is an undetermined number of Smaller World Scales below us â microorganisms, molecules, atoms, â¦ â and another undetermined number of Larger World Scales above us â planets, stars, constellations, .... \n\nPrinciple IV â Empiric â Time and Space Relationship: \nThe Life Scale is directly proportional to the Space Scale. As smaller the Space Scale of an Entity as small it is the respective Life Scale of that Entity. \nNature clearly shows that there is a relationship between Life Scales and Space Scales â the empiric observation demonstrates that the absolute life time of a planet is much longer than of a human. And the absolute life time of a human is much longer than of a butterfly â so, there is an evident empiric relationship between Time and Space that we humans never saw and took into scientific consideration. \nExample of an empiric formula that can be applied: \n\nLife_Scale = K x Space_Scale \n( K ~ 30 years\/meters for mammals ) \n\nPrinciple V â Empiric â Imaginary Multidimensional Worlds existence: \nIn Euclidâs geometry, if we consider ourselves a point in a plan, we only can observe just a line: this means that if we are a point in a two dimensions world, we only can percept one dimension. \nThe same rule can be extrapolated to understand that if we are an Entity in a four dimensions World Scale (X, Y, Z, and Time) there is, at least, another extra dimension that we cannot see or understand its existence because it is not possible to percept it from the World Scale where we are in. Only using the imaginary complex number i=(-1) Â½ it is possible to mathematically define that imaginary dimension from the World Scale where we do belong. \nThis takes us to the conclusion that multidimensional Worlds DO exist and we are part of Multidimensional Worlds with, at least, an extra dimension that we cannot observe or understand, because they are imaginary to us: i=(-1) Â½. \n\nPrinciple VI â Empiric â Relative Intelligence and Relative Perspective: \nCan we ask to a blind born human the reason why the sea is blue? If the Entity does not percept the atmosphere color dimension, because it was never a Real Dimension in its World Scale, it is not possible for him to justify that phenomenon. The Entity only can make that justification if he is capable of creating a mathematical model where the sky color dimension is introduced as an imaginary dimension i=(-1) Â½. \nSo, we have to introduce two new concepts: the Relative Perspective and the Relative Intelligence. \nRELATIVE PERSPECTIVE is the set of Real Dimensions that the Entity cans percept from its World Scale. \nRELATIVE INTELLIGENCE is the capability of the Entity to understand, to predict and to make use of phenomena happening inside its World Scaleâs Relative Perspective. By this principle all entities are rational and intelligent in their respective Relative Perspective Referentials. \nSo, the Human Kind or any other Entity, only can justify the scientific phenomena that are totally functions of Dimensions that are Real (and not Imaginary) in the World Scale of that Entity. Unless the Entity is intelligent enough to extrapolate its relative perspective using imaginary dimensions, i=(-1) Â½, in their mathematical models. \n\nPrinciple VII â Empiric â The Extra Imaginary Dimension existence principle: \nWhy our Planet Earth has to change its rotation routines? Why there are Gravitational Forces that should approach the macrocosms but, instead, the cosmos is splitting itself? How can we justify scientific phenomena that we cannot understand?

{"prompt":"Tony Cragg\n\nI am writing to you re Tony Cragg's article on Wikipedia, which I have been trying to improve. As you quite rightly pointed out, (prior to my editing) Wikipedia's coverage of Cragg's life and career is embarrassingly weak and what I have added is not 'necessarily bad.'\n\nI am new to Wikipedia editing and it has been difficult to get to grips with how it works, but I feel like I am getting there. For all my efforts to be deleted would be a real shame. I would like to start up a dialogue so I can continue to improve Cragg's article.\n\nAs I understand it, you have identified the section on the Sculpture Park as posing a potential copyright issue, as a copy or modification of the text from Cragg's website. I did indeed use his website as a point of reference (for lack of other sources) but I am surprised you consider what I edited to be a copyright issue. I will happily work on this section further so as to improve it but I ask that you 'unblock' the rest of article and advise the best way to proceed.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you  \nHi! It is quite amazing to me that someone so well known could have such a poor article here, but that can happen; it will be blanked for a week or so now so that anybody who wants to rewrite it can do so. I do understand that it's very hard to get started as an editor here, and certainly I don't want to make it harder for you. However, you may inadvertently have fallen foul of some of our basic rules, including the one about using several accounts (that isn't in itself a problem, but becomes one if the accounts break other rules, such as, unfortunately, our copyright policy). One of the four accounts has declared a connection to the Lisson Gallery, and the IP address obviously belongs to the gallery; it would be helpful to know if the other three editors who appear to be similarly connected, including you, are so connected, or indeed are all the same real-world person. If you have a connection to the gallery you probably have what we call a conflict of interest, and that means that in most cases you shouldn't edit the article, but limit yourself to suggestions on the talk page. I'm prepared to help with the writing in this case. A good first step would be to start assembling some independent reliable sources about the artist. These should be sources of information that do not have an interest in promoting him, so commercial art gallery websites are unlikely to be acceptable, but websites of public institutions, books, well-known newspapers and magazines are all likely to be good. You could perhaps list some of those on the talk page of the article. While it's helpful if I can see them, it's not obligatory. Then we can take it from there. ->","completion":" none"}

I also learned more about the WP distinction between Primary and Secondary sources.  The result is all to the good. I'll take your word that the oldprodfull  template is a good thing, though I think on first sight that the template's terse wording  \"\"This article was proposed for deletion by an editor in the past\"\"   could be clearer as to its intent: does this really suffice to, in your words, \"\"let future editors know that the article has already been through the proposed deletion process once and is no longer eligible for deletion without a proper discussion or other reason\"\"?  I hope so, though it was not obvious to me: it reads more like an invitation to agree or disagree to deletion and so reprise the issue.  If you can see it that way, as a relatively novice editor might, perhaps the oldprodfull template could be expanded to that effect, with some procedural directives and relevant links, to the original PROD and the policy guidelines for continuance.

That is, meaning someone that makes, often erroneous, allegations to authorities in order to personally benefit themselves in some way. It is certianly a lot less intentionally insulting than to be continuously called a meatpuppet or, I am sure, for user Canaen to be accused of having some connection with me when he has none.\n\nThe funniest thing for me is that  is busy digging a hole in his own canoe because his allegations are outright lies of which he can in no way substantiate.\n\nThis conflict started because  insisted on posting data refering to anorexics on the Vegan topic which had no relationship to veganism whatsoever.\n\n is entirely wrong.

I am sure that you are just or even more upset as being accused of a connection with me when you have none.\n\nUnfortunately though, that is the depth of 's lies and the shallowness of 's integrity. \n\n Where he has no grounds he invents them and he is, oh, so clever at playing WikiTricks with all these technical terms and methods. \n\nI am starting to feel like a Jew in Nazi Germany being hunted down, connected to individuals which I have no connection with and their so-called crimes and accused of crimes which are not mine. \n\nAnd what of ?

McGrauw (not logged in)\n\nI think the whole perceptions of cuteness section should be removed to improve the focus of the article. What things people find cute and possible reasons for that is an interesting question, but it is an anthropological question and serves only to muddle this article.\n\nIn any case, the \"\"Every time you masturbate...\"\" joke should be removed. It was popular among internet humorists for a while, but not really worthy of note outside of its own article; also, it is an off color joke and goes completely against the tone of the rest of the article.\n\nAny thoughts?\n \nHey.. i was looking for imformation on how to take care of abandoned kittens and came acrossed the discussion board.. i cant believe like a page was devoted to whether or not an article should linked on the page.. who really cares... i hope yas rnt losing sleep over it...(n)... i dunt mean to sound like a biotch... but its boring to read about all the complaints... and the point of the board is to write about cats\/kittens.. atleast thats what the impression i got .. could b wrong though (anon)\n\nThe reference to the \"\"Every time you masturbate...\"\" joke should be removed. It does nothing to enhance the article. And every time some kid looks up kitten on wikipedia, a parent has to answer questions about masturbation. It's offensive, if nothing else.  \n\nIn response to the first anon, this page is actually for discussion on how the article can be improved. Some off-topic comments are usually tolerated but long discussion threads are generally seen as disruptive.\nIn response to Wabazana, Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors. However, I do agree that this particular reference is a bit of a systemic bias towards nerdy references. I've boldly changed it to refer to Hello Kitty (which was already in 'see also'), which I think we can agree is going to be more familiar to the average reader.  \n\nLovely though it is, is \"\"perceptions of cuteness\"\" really encyclopaedic?   \nWell, it's interesting. It's written in a neutral point of view. And as regards verifiability, if 'kittens are cute' isn't common knowledge, then I don't know what is. So yes, I for one think it's encyclopaedic.  ( T | C | A ) \n\nI read about the '\"\"perceptions of cuteness\"\" discussion on the wiki kitten page in the Wall Street Journal, Wed. August 15th edition, and was thrilled.

{"prompt":"\"Is Ethylene Glycol a Synonym for Antifreeze?\n\nUpdate 2 My intent in editing out the extraneous information of ethylene glycol poisoning in the Antifreeze article is that many editors and visitors to the Article are of the impression that all antifreeze is ethylene gylcol. This is a misconception. Case in point? Look above at the comments made by Flyer22 and TechnoSymbiosis. 1. Note that they mention articles in which the poisonous chemical is the Article in question. 2. Lead, Mercury (element), Asbestos, Benzodiazepine, paracetamol. That is a list of six 5 chemical substances and asbestos, which is virtually a chemical species for the purposes of this discussion. 3. Note also that the article in question here is not about a specific chemical, rather it is about a wide range of substances including the poisonous and deadly methanol and ethylene glycol. The article isn't about a chemical species like mercury or lead. It is about liquids (plural) which have special properties in commerce and mechanics and discusses practical applications of chemicals.\n\nSo when auto mechanics or airplane mechanics discuss antifreeze, or when chemists discuss it or talk about it, this poisoning aspect is a rare but useful part of the discussion. It is only when talking about this topic medically that the need arises to discuss the many symptoms and embark upon long-winded treatises on what happens internally to a person intoxicated on a particular antifreeze. In commercial, practical, and chemical discussions, the fact that something is toxic arises obtusely to the main concern.\n\nTake those ethylene glycol warnings to the Ethylene glycol page and (if there was any sudden interest in it) to the Methanol article, which would be consistent with the 6 examples listed above. As a sideline, why aren't there any warnings of the deadliness of methanol, which is soooooo poisonous that it takes 10 mL of it to blind a person, and 30 mL to kill. Sounds pretty notable by the above standards, so let's list all of the symptoms in the antifreeze article, too. Or not. That would be borderline absurd, since the ethylene glycol lobby dictates that ethylene glycol is synonymous with Antifreeze.\n\nAnother absurd corollary would be to go to the Thermal insulation page and discuss how poisonous Asbestos is. I mean, all insulation is asbestos, right?\n\nTo summarize, this argument is about the scope of Antifreeze. I don't think this scope encompasses the symptoms of poisoning (from a particular type of antifreeze) which happen to be so difficult to spot that they deserve the full attention available at the Good Article named Ethylene glycol poisoning where all of the nuances of medical research and diagnosis can be discussed at length.   \n\n So fix the misconception, don't just blank an entire section.  \n\n Most antifreeze is still ethylene glycol. It's hardly an obscure risk.     \n\nNo one is or has stated that \"\"ethylene glycol is a synonym for antifreeze.\"\" And the misconception that \"\"all antifreeze is ethylene gylcol\"\" can also be mentioned in the aforementioned section, although I have not read anyone in the discussions about this on this talk page express any misconception (especially since you've expressd such concerns before). Somehow, you are completely missing the point about why you are wrong to repeatedly remove this information. The point is that ethylene glycol poisoning, which is a part of this article, causes these symtoms; and therefore, there should be an appropriate summary of these symptoms, per WP:Summary style, before pointing readers to the article about it. It is not \"\"extraneous information.\"\" So once again, I will contact WP:MED to comment here on this issue. In the meantime, this information stays per the WP:Consensus against your repeated removal of it. 134.255.247.88    \n\n\" ->","completion":" none"}

Unfortunately German Nazi did it and why? Germans supported Hitler so much or what? Why the Germans did not stop Hitler before he got to much power? Etc. etc. That question the ethic of all nation is not it? And, are you referring by some accident to others then the Nazis actions? Where is the proof that some bandits of Polish nationality did it?

They have a tendency to overreach, exaggerating the roles of Japanese gangsters and ex-military American bit-players when the bankers, politicians and CIA operatives are scary enough. They know the Philippines well, but are unreliable on Japan and do not read Japanese. The book is full of errors that could easily be corrected by a second-year student of the language â the ship they repeatedly call the Huzi is accurately romanised Fuji; the important Japan Sea port is Maizuru, not Maisaru; tairiki is not a Japanese word: they mean tairiku ronin (a âContinental adventurerâ or a âChina carpetbaggerâ); and their mysterious Lord Ichivara is an absurdity â no one was ever called âLordâ in postwar Japan and Ichivara is an impossible name (it is surely Ishihara).â?

By making a shallow assumption on pen-names? Expectations? The God-given right to anonymity on the Internet? How fucking petty are you and the idiot who made you an administrator? What next, are you going to ban Iranians from editing or contributing to Iran-related articles? Indeed not just a laughable policy, but indeed a dangerous one as well. Most of the world-class authorities are Iranians. With your fucked up logic, we should dismiss their contributions because irrespective of their content, you'll instead look at their political affiliations and their names and put it into the bin of rejection. Oh right, you're Swiss and because Switzerland is this shining paragon of neutrality hosting thousands of bank accounts of Islamic terror organization, you're obviously this stereotypical neutralist... Good lord, listen to yourself. \n\nLuckily academia doesn't work like that. Scholarly enterprise and political affiliations remain strictly separated. So it doesn't really matter if Kaveh Farrokh or anyone else is a self-declared outspoken Nazi, Communist, Socialist, Liberal, Conservative or what have you, it has no bearing on content that must be assessed purely by content. That's NPOV. A sober, neutral, objective approach, just bare-bones, bare-knuckles source critique. Source. Critique. Make an assessment on the content, not the person(s). You marginalized IranianGuy. Period. And as conveniently as you shrugged him off because of his pen-name, you shrugged off his fully legitimate criticism of your approach. No matter what country or pen-name or real name you have, it has a universal stamp: Asshole behaviour.   \n\n\" ->","completion":" toxic"}

{"prompt":"Wikimania 2006\nIn the course of informal discussions at Wikimania in Frankfurt the possibility of having Wikimania 2006 in Vancouver was raised.  What makes Canada desirable for such a meeting is the capacity to draw delegates from the United States.  For many overseas delegates, however, U.S. visa requirements make that country less attractive.  All else being equal, Europeans see Vancouver as a more interesting Canadian city to visit than Toronto, the only other Canadian city to receive significant consideration.\n\nPreliminary bids from various cities need to be made by Sept. 30, 2005.  A short list will be drawn from those bids.  Is there enough interest and energy to put together such a conference in Vancouver for August 2006?  The people in Frankfurt put on a tremendous gathering, with a core organizational group of about a dozen people.  Some 400 people attended from 52 different countries.\n\nI expect that a North American Wikimania could be a little smaller, but we would still need a suitable facility.  It would be good to know that such a facility is available for a conference; the type of youth hostel facility that was used in Frankfurt does not exist in North America.  What would be the cost of hosting such a conference at UBC?\n\nI'm looking for interest and commitment.  To that end I am proposing a Vancouver meetup for Saturday, Sept. 24.  If someone has a reasonably accesible place for such a meeting please let me know.

Curiously, I would generally apply that assessment much more to Esoglou than to LoveMonkey.  \nYou've probably missed this but neither Phatius nor I have asserted Esoglou is innocent of the charges.  I haven't looked at your edits in close detail but what I've seen does look troubling and worth a closer look.  I expect Phatius has looked more closely and he seems to think there are some issues with Esoglou's conduct.  It's almost as if we've jumped past the trial and moved to the sentencing phase where Phatius and I are pleading leniency on the basis of redeeming qualities and extenuating circumstances.\nAs for the focus on LoveMonkey (and I know you disagree with my view on this), my attitude is that if Wikipedia can put up with LoveMonkey, it can put up with ten Esoglous. \n  \" ->","completion":" none"}
